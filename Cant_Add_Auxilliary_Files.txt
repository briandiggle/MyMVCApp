Adding files in add walk
------------------------

What Happens
============
The "Additional files" area does not allow you to choose a file which is present in the local filesystem, inside the web root.

When "Choose file" is clicked:
1) the jQuery .change handler is fired.
2) AJAX method /Walks/CheckFileInWebrootJSON is called, supplying the path to the file in the imagepath parameter
3) However, the supplied path is tampered with by Chrome - the real path is substituted with "fakepath".
4) Because "fakepath" is outside the web root, the file is not added.

Problem
=======
Security settings in chrome and ie now mean that the use of the file html input type is no longer useful.

The following string is sent as the AJAX request:#
http://localhost:4845/Walks/CheckFileInWebrootJSON?imagepath=C%3A%5Cfakepath%5Cpuig_caragoler_title.jpg


Solution
========
Use the method of attaching files which is used by adding images.

Create a "Check image" JSON method.
