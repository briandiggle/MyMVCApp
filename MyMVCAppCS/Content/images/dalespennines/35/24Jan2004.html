    <td><p>With Ross Bromley</p>
      <p>We almost caused the 'the horton riots' by parking in the station car 
        park. We were legally allowed to do so, but had to cross a small private 
        road to get to it! First a station worker and then a local gent gave us 
        a telling off. I was chuffed to see how my &quot;gentle answer turned 
        away wrath&quot; with the local gent who wished us a good day on the fells 
        as we left.</p>
      <p>When I'm walking with Ross there is no need to pay any attention to the 
        map. He is equipped with sufficient gear to survive the worst weather 
        imaginable. A top-of-the-range GPS makes navigation childs-play. There 
        was a little mist shrouding the top of Ingleborough though by the time 
        we got to the top this had cleared somewhat. Cloud cover kept breaking 
        to reveal surprise views.</p>
      <p>We took shelter just off top and had the luxury of a newly brewed hot 
        drink, made from an impressively small stove thing. I'm warming to the 
        idea of this camping thing. If I could do it <em>in</em> the mountains 
        with good equipment in decent weather it may be really good. My memories 
        of roughing it in this country are very much tainted by the all consuming 
        effect eczema had on those experiences. I just wanted to go home.</p>
      <p>Other memories- azure blue lake near horton open-cast so incongruous 
        like a wound on the earth, two stiles over walls instead of one (this 
        place must get busy, or are they for overtaking?), A couple working on 
        footpath drainage, wierd peat hags, good to be back in 'limestone country'.</p>
