<h2><i>Great Whernside</i></h2>
<h3>15 October 2004 </h3>
<p> Again the weather came good at just the right time for this walk.</p>
<p>Ross had the reins so I even decided to leave my map behind. After all with compass<br>
  ,GPS and a mountain leadership course you should be OK. And even if anything should go<br>
  wrong, I was confident that there would be enough supplies to oulast a nuclear winter in <br>
  Ross's rucksack.</p>
<p>Start of walk was a bit bizarre This Guy-like effigy on top of a 30' high totem poll made of<br>
  rusty old barrels greeted us as we entered Kettlewell. There was some kind of urban scarecrow<br>
  building contest going on. Or was it to scare outlanders away. The welcome was warmer than<br>
  in Horton-in-Ribblesdale. There was no chance this time of starting the Kettlewell riots.</p>
<p>A beautiful clear day with great visability a little wind awaited us. We climbed out of kellewell<br>
  on our way towards Hag Dike. Ross's map route choice came slightly into question as he <br>
  crossed the stream precariously. I decided to assert my independence and backtracked to<br>
  the safety of the path.</p>
<p>Next bit of excitement was the finding of my first geocache. Ross trusted me with his<br>
  GPS which I misread and had us wandering about in the wrong direction. I finally found it<br>
  at 


 N 54&deg; 09.366 W 002&deg; 00.975, called <em>Which? ditch</em>. It had a scouting theme, as it was<br>
 in full view of the Ben Rhydding Scouting centre (empty that day). Could have taken a <br>
woggle or a lump of blue john. </p>
<p>Just as we got to the summit of Great Whernside things turned for the worse as a) we <br>
  met the first fellow walkers of the day and b)the cloud rolled in from the nidderdale side.<br>
  Ross rushed off to get a glimpse of nidderdale before all disappeared. Actually, the<br>
weather did improve after this, though the clear skies had gone.</p>
<p>Now for a bit of luxury as Madame Chaule gets out her methane stove, kettle, and <br>
  sundry accoutrements. Soon were supping hot chocolate ( and claymore whisky in my<br>
  case. I  declined not to offer Ross any whisky after his comments earlier about its<br>
  dehydrating effects!). There was one minor hitch in the process when the methane<br>
  stove exploded. Ross put out the conflagration and congratulated himself that he<br>
had followed best advice in planting the bomb a few feet away from us.</p>
<p>We walked along the ridge towards little whernside, which looked as we approached<br>
  a nicer shaped mountain than its big brother. Great views of upper nidderdale from <br>
  the location of the Nidd Head Spring. We didnt spend much time at the location of the <br>
  spring so I can only say that we were in roughly the right place. We then followed the<br>
  ridge NE until we picked up the footpath going roughtly SE towards Tor Dike. This<br>
  was a traditional dales boggy trudge. At Cam Head we took the track S through<br>
Cam pasture, down to Kettlewell.</p>
<p>Its great to walk with friends. I suppose I feel slightly that walking to me is time when<br>
  I can catch up with my best friend and have prescious time with Him - so feel a little<br>
  frustrated that there was no chance of this in all the hours away which I had today. <br>
