<h3><i>Rogan's Seat<br>
<br>
30th September 2002</i></h3>
<h4><i>First look at the farthest dale. After 1hr 50 in the
car had to stop myself thinking that I could have been parked in
kentmere in the same time.</i></h4>
<p><i>Chose a lovely day this walk. Very clear. Did cloud
over later to make things pretty bleak on the top.</i></p>

<td>Parked at Keld and set off in bright sunshine following
the course of the swale. Crossed over at the first opportunity. Most of
the traffic round here seems to be people doing the coast-to-coast
walk. It seemed to be generally assumed that walkers were doing this.
Climbed up higher above the swale and took a look an an abandoned lead
miners' dwelling. Opposite is Lovely Seat </td>

<p><i>Arrived in Muker in no time, at the farmers'
arms (after trying to get into the outhouse to the amusement of
locals). Nice lunch there before it was time for the serious walking -
up to rogans seat. At the start of the footpath, a sign read 'Footpath
impassble in web weather conditions' which I found rather strange. It
all became evident when I reached the banks of the Swale. The map
indicated I should go straight across! There was no footbridge, not
even any stepping stones. So off with boots and sock to attempt a dry
crossing via stones. First attempt nearly went badly wrong as I
stumbled and a boot tied to my rucksack swung round and hit me in the
face.. I came back with renewed determination and tighly tied-on boots.
This time I traversed quite skillfully ( though it wasnt very graceful
).Picture below shows the path I took.</i></p>

track. Turned left off this track at the intersection of the stream
from Moss dam</i></p>
