      <p>MVBC mens weekend away at Low Mill Outdoor Centre at Askrigg in Wensleydale.</p>
      <p>Yesterday was an all-action event with high ropes, gorge walking and night walk down the roman road from the end of this walk to the pub in Askrigg.</p>
      <p>The only options today were Hell's Gill gorgewalk involving no-opt out dive into deep plunge-poll and swim. Or canoeing. I.e. both options not so comfortable for someone who can swim about 10ft across a swimming pool after a but of practice.</p>
      <p>Ross and Dave Newall also opted for this option. But the party of 3 split into an A party (myself) who unanimously wanted to climb up to Drumaldrace from Gayle and a B party who were content to repeat much of the same ground of yesterdays night walk.</p>
      <p>So we set a rendez-vous point ( about SD 882 874 ) to meet for the traditional Ross Rapid-boil hot chocolate. Ross handed me the only map which we had. Both of us had GPS. Ross prefers not to use his deluxe GPS but rely on ML (Mountain Leadship) skills and there is certain difference of emphasis,shall we say, in our reliance on GPS. Suffice to say that once the car was out of sight, the map was briefly used but chiefly to plot the rendez-vous point into the GPS! This I later confessed to Ross who's school-masterly look of dissappointment I took secret delight in!</p>
      <p>Headed straight for the rendez-vous across fields. My path came across an elderly farmer with about 3.5 teeth in an age-old wool jumper. Like a lost sheep I said &quot;Am I in the right place?&quot;. He was accomodating and pointed the way for me to continue trespassing.</p>
      <p>I was determined to beat the two lads to the RV so yomped from here on in. It was about 3 clicks and quite an ascent. Only my lack of trust in the GPS cost me time in the end! I arrived at the RV 5 mins after the lads to find the water no even on the boil.</p>
      <p>The reward for my solo A party was that I was treated to a visit to the summit alone, and had time to pray a little and leave a marker.</p>
      <p>The weekends highlight for me though was Saturday mornings quite time when God spoke to me that I am not defined any longer as someone who has a &quot;love deficit&quot; but by 1 Tim 1:14 &quot;The grace of our Lord Jesus was poured out on me abundantly along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus&quot;. This was my experience this weekend in this high intensity extrovert environment -I was filled with resources for all and evething that came my way. </p>
