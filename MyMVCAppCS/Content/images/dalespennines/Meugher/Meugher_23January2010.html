<p><em>1. </em><em>55 minutes only from
Blackmoor Court, the day started much better than promised. Parked
opposite the pub where the landlord made me Egg and Chips for lunch and
stopped to chat with me (his only customer) a few years back. This
friendliness was a feature today as well.<br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_1.jpg" /></em></p>
<p><em>2. </em><em>Little changed since
my last visit, the converted wesleyan chapel. The distinctive "farm"
smell greeted the visitor on approach, the first building on the left
being occupied with cows...</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_2.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>3. </em><em>First section of the
walk was on the Nidderdale Way. A great start in sunshine with the
first sign of the snow which would be a big part of the walk.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_3.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>4.&nbsp;</em><em></em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_4.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>5. View from Stean Pasture - Middlesmoor
middle right, Stean village below. Rain Stang above.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_5.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>6. </em><em>Near Moor House, the
FP was unclear. That together with barking dogs persuaded me to go
round heading a little up Whit Beck. Each farm passed had its dogs, and
I had the feeling the my passing was well noted and was looking forward
to the anonymity of the high moors. This was the first encounter with
deep snow of the day. This snow had drifted to around 2 or 3 feet deep
and was nicely frozen on &nbsp;top- I didnt fall through (on this
occasion).</em></p>
<p><em>This section also introduced me to another
feature of this walk- rabbits dead or alive. Three rabbits were lying
dead together on the ground. I wondered why? Later I found out!</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_6.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>7. Approaching the first "shooting box" . This
seems to be a nice feature of this area - shooting hut providing an
escape from the elements left open for the occasional walker to enjoy. </em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_7.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>8. </em><em>Inside the shooting
box. Enjoyed cuppa rather than booze as shown! Two new skills learnt
today - early on was how to make a nice flask of tea by stewing "in
situ". The other was how( not) to fit gaiters. I was surprised to
realise that like crampons, gaiters are also secured by running an
attachment under the instep. I couln't work out what the second set of
laces was, dispensed with them. Then I found that each time my foot
went into the deep snow, the gaiter was forced over the top of the boot
and a little snow entered over the top. By the end of the walk, despite
having gaiters on, my feet and boots were soaked.</em><br />

</p>
<p><em>10. First shooting box looking towards
Middlesmoor. Just as I was leaving, a farmer was approaching on a quad.
I was sure he had seen me shutting the door and thought I'd get told
off. In fact he was friendly and disappeared up the track with two dogs.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_10.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>11. </em><em>The cloud level was
around 650 meters all day - Great Whernside was in mist. Most of the
vista had &nbsp;a kind of "widescreen" look!</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_11.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>12. It was around here between the two
"shooting boxes" that the farmer came back with his two dogs. He
stopped and switch off the quad and was very chatty. One of his first
questions was "Where are you from"? Leeds probably didnt seem to
surprise him or put him off. I further showed my "offcomer" nature by
saying I was off "Mewer". "Ah yes Mewfer"&nbsp; I got to demontrate
my local knowledge late in the day as the first farm on the way down
was interested in where I had been - "Mewfer" I replied! He was giving
his two dogs a little run out hunting rabbits. I showed by ignorance
asking if the dead animal in the cage on the quad was a hare. "Hares
disappeared 25 years ago - no, it 's a rabbit". "They need thinning
out". I could understand what he meant because they did seem
everywhere. He told also the story of how after the winter of 1947 it
is said that snow was collected from Meugher and taken to the
Nidderdale Show in September. He also said the little hump near us
called "Stock Ridge" was in a national paper a couple of year back as
the geographical centre of Britain.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_12.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>13. Found this lying on the snow by the track
- another kill- is it a baby shrew?</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_13.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>14. </em><em>Much more snow now
approaching the second shooting box</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_14.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>15. </em><em>Looking over to
Little Whernside, which stayed just below the cloud ceiling all day.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_15.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>16. Rain stang to the right</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_16.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>17. The second higher "shooting box" and the
last homely house in the West. This really did fell like the edge of
the wild. From here, there is no road in sight only miles and miles of
high moorland and mountain. Nowhere in the Lakes feels like this.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_17.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>18. </em><em>The second shooting
box where I had lunch. Looking towards Great Haw in the centre.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_18.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>19. </em><em>It was only at this
stage that the main objective for the day comes into view, and I was
surprised with how well defined the hill was. Lots of deep snow stood
between me and the OS pillar on top. Alot of it was the worst stuff -
deep but with a poorly frozen surface so that I one step I would be on
top, the next a foot down as the surface collapsed. Hard work!</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_19.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>20. The most dramatic moment of the day came
when this cloud inversion appeared as altitude was gained and the view
West was revealed. I assumed this was Whernside?</em><em></em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_20.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>21.&nbsp;</em><em></em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_21.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>22. This was the point at which the track
turned away from Meugher and the hardest section of the walk began.
Walking on the western facing slopes the snow was wet and unstable, but
still deep. I had 600m to cross to the summit. At times I was hopping
between grass tussocks peeping out. </em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_22.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>23. </em><em>Is that sharp haw
peeping out to the left?</em><br />

<p><em>39. Descending off the Eastern flank of
Meugher, although there was more snow, it was more stable and easier to
walk on. At times I was aware of walking over a concealed stream and
hoped I wouldnt end up in it!</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="Meugher_23January2010_39.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>40. Had to cross this stream defile and felt a

hidden crevasses!</em><em></em><br />

going very hard work</em><em></em><br />

<p><em>42. At last, rejoining the track and easier
progress.</em><br />
