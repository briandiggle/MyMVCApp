      <p>I have two big things to deal with - first and most importantly , thinking about Tanzania and what next steps there are for us. Then the immediate distracting issue of the terribly bad feedback I got from my DI application at work.</p>
      <p>At a meeting last week I find that I have been characterised (by someone on the Panel) as having an unhelpful attitude to work and being isolated in the department. I find this initially quite difficult to deal with and today was spent just bringing my anger and sense of injustice to God and trying to battle through to a place of correct perspective and peace that will enable me to return to work and tackle the issue. At the end of the walk I was in a better place, able to face the big questions of the present without the pall of discouragement and confusion that was weighing heavily upon me before. </p>
      <p>The day started bright and clear as I wandered up to Skipton Castle. I was directed to the entrance to Skipton Woods - opposite the old Pork Pie Shoppe. The wood itself was closed for renovation work! I decided to enter without the ability to sue if something untoward should happen. Off roaded to the end of the finger of the wood pointing Northwards.</p>
      <p>The weather started to turn quite rainy as I left Skipton. But no rain, no rainbow.. and I was treated to a stunning rainbow as I walked North over the golfcourse.</p>
      <p>Sharp Haw was a nice little peak. I find it hard to think of airedale as beautiful - must of it is the ex-industrial mess of the Shipley- Bingley etc. But further up its not so bad! </p>
