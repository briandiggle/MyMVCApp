<h2><i>Wormald Green to South Stainley via Burton Leonard<</i></h2>
<h3>22 April 2005</h3>
<p> 14Km - Sunny</p>
<p>Running out of walks in new territory from the 36 bus route,<br>
  this was the obvious one with the extra interest of visiting<br>
  Burton Leonard. Did a bit of research on Burton Leonard Cricket<br>
  Club and found their website. A section on club history included<br>
a photo of the 1950 team with Dad in the front row!</p>
<p>Stepped off at wormald green and had a look at the first <br>
  historical marker - the George Inn pub where the Diggles had their<br>
  golden? wedding. It is now up for sale at auction in June.<br>
  First part of the walk followed a footpath over fields and <br>
  arriving at the perfect place to spy out old ground - the<br>
  score board of the cricket club near Peter Lane.</p>
<p>The &quot;Monkton Mains&quot; farm had redirected the footpath <br>
  without any indication away from the farm. So I had decided<br>
  to get out of view of the farm buildings (had already met<br>
  the farmer) and &quot;off road&quot; back onto the footpath position<br>
  using the GPS. It turned out that the re-routed footpath<br>
  followed the exact position I was going to take! Sat <br>
  down for a coffee and listened to the peace of the <br>
  countryside. How I need this space. I have been unable to<br>
  get any time to unwind since christmas with Linda not<br>
  being well, the operation, and all my church responsibilities.</p>
<p>I was going to use the time to re-think what I am <br>
  currently doing because it has become clear to me that its<br>
  too much at the moment to carry. Talking to Pete during the<br>
  week was great as it became clear to both of us that<br>
  I obviously need to cut stuff out or I will go under. The<br>
  list of church responsibilities at present - elder, lead<br>
  worship once a month, lead community outreach group, co-lead<br>
  housegroup. Add to this the stress of Linda not being in <br>
  a good place with the operation and the stress of all<br>
  the issues around adoption. I could do all the church if<br>
  things were good at home- but they-re not.</p>
<p>Most of the day I just walked slowly, taking in the <br>
  surroundings. I was walking in a gently rolling <br>
  landscape of fields descending to the Vale of York around<br>
  the middle of the day, then rising back up.</p>
<p>More and more I can appreciate walks such as this without<br>
  the grandeur of mountain scenery. I took the book on wild<br>
  flowers I bought in February at York with the aim of<br>
  identifying my first wild flower.</p>
<p>Excitiment mounted as I approached the outskirts of Burton<br>
  Leonard. I suddenly came upon the score-board building of<br>
  BLCC. Taking a leak round the back I wondered if my Dad <br>
  had ever peed in the same spot?!</p>
<p>My next task was to spy out the Wrays house on Peter Lane,<br>
  take some photos and move on un-noticed. The old scrap<br>
  yard at the edge of their house has been sold and three<br>
  houses have been built on the site, the nearest having<br>
  been built right up against the boundary. I walked<br>
  out into the central green space of the village. The <br>
  next ritual was to buy something at the village store<br>
  and sit in the shelter opposite with a coffee and watch<br>
  the village go by.</p>
<p>Next stop was the church opposite where Ladbroke House used<br>
  to be. Lost of old trees including a baby yew taken , a<br>
  cutting from the 2000 year old Buxted yew. It is one of 7000 yews<br>
  distributed in Autumn 1999 from cuttings of
  ancient yews to mark the<br>
  millenium.
  I actually recognised two mature Scots Pines nearest <br>
  to Ladbroke House and remembered looking out of the sitting room <br>
  window at their straight trunks.</p>
<p>Last mandatory stop on memory lane was to stand in the <br>
  middle of the little close crammed with houses on the <br>
  site of the old apple orchard. Round the back of the <br>
  larger house built on the actual Ladbroke House site<br>
  there still seems to be some of the old ramshackle <br>
  garden and trees.</p>
<p>Went a short way up mill lane and then took the footpath<br>
  on the right leading on the edge of new house building to<br>
  straight lane. Here I picked up a glossy yellow <br>
  wild flower with its foliage for later indentification.<br>
  This turned out to be a Lesser Celandile or Pile Wort!<br>
  I felt a sense of jubilation at having begun to discover<br>
  a rich new world. Road side verges are no longer places<br>
  to ignore but rich wild habitats where wild flowers have<br>
  can grow undisturbed away from the managed farm fields.</p>
<p>Onward to Red Hills Lane, then taking the footpath to<br>
  the right towards moor farm. This is one of those farms<br>
  where the location of footpaths has disappeared. I had<br>
  to walk straight across a sown field (not too bad at this<br>
  time of year, the crop only knee high). When arriving at<br>
  the farm buildings the route of the FP was blocked so had<br>
  to tramp round the back.</p>
<p>Now headed on the FP towards foster flatts farm looking for<br>
  a place to stop for lunch. There is an area of managed<br>
  grouse-rearing woodland between these two farms. I stopped<br>
  in a clearing-area to the left of the FP with some old<br>
  woodcutting equipment. This was a much nicer way to take<br>
  lunch than in some un-friendly dingy pub- warm, quiet,<br>
  private with just the odd butterfly and squirrel for <br>
  company.</p>
<p>Off to foster flatts farm and strode boldly throught <br>
  the middle of the farm buildings though afterwards noticed<br>
  that the FP actually skirted them on the L.<br>
  On the track to the farm I noticed a large ash tree with<br>
  some of last year's keys so grabbed hold of a set. At this<br>
  point the farmer passed in his car looking rather bemused!</p>
<p>At the junction with Boroughbridge road, turned left towards<br>
  Roecliffe moor and explored an area of Beech woodland with<br>
  blue-bells just coming towards their peak. This path took<br>
  me to Copgrove then took the FP near the bridge into <br>
  Mountgarret estates land. I noticed this landowner has put<br>
  alot of effort into tree-planting. Many individual trees,<br>
  often horse-chestnut have been planted along with whole<br>
  new woodland areas.</p>
<p>The path then followed the route of the beck and joins the<br>
  Ripon Rowel. The point at which the Rowel turns right there<br>
  is a T junction with a signpost and old boundary stone. I<br>
  placed a marker next to the E side of this stone as pretty<br>
  much the highest point of the day.</p>
<p>Just before I got to Stainley hall farm I notice to the R<br>
  of the FP an small patch of natural woodland. I peered <br>
  with and saw a magical scene like the Shire in the Spring-<br>
  a carpet of woodland flowers of all types. Couldnt resist<br>
  entering and standing in the stillness taking in this<br>
  wonderful scene. It had a feeling of natural enchantment.</p>
<p>The last excitement of the day was the only geocache in this<br>
  area at SE 30857 62992. Found it within seconds and left my<br>
  now customary calling card - Matt 13:44</p>
