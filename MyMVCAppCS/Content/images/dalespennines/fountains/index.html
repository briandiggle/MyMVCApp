<h2><i>Around Fountains Abbey</i></h2>
<h3>28th October 2003</h3>
<p> <a href="fountains_map.jpg">Map</a></p>
<p>Decided on this walk today because it offered some time in forest. I've really 
  been<br>
  into the autumn tints this year and have appreciated the beauty of this season<br>
  more than ever before. Missed out on a walk in the lakes at the weekend so<br>
  this was a bonus.</p>
<p>Started at the car park at fountains bridge with worship blasting away! I felt 
  a<br>
  sense of urgency about the future today. It was a day to dream old dreams. A 
  <br>
  day for a 'old man' to dream. Headed off into Spring Wood and began praying.<br>
  This urgency came on me about our call to the nations. It was a time to take<br>
  stock and I felt a need to plan a route to get there.</p>
<p>I entered a clearing in Spa Gill Woods. As I came into this area a real burden<br>
  came on me and had to stop, bent and weeping. Oh I want to be there, for <br>
  the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. When I look back 
  at <br>
  the end of my life I want to know that I have spent the best years of my life<br>
  serving the Lord in the nations. Later on I felt that I should pray that I will<br>
  be there on my 40th birthday. I want to give at least 20 years. In the clearing<br>
  there was a shooting hut/tree house which I climbed into and prayed. <br>
  [see photos 1&amp;2]<br>
  <br>
  The next day, the next door neighbour george (aka. teshak) died suddenly of<br>
  a heart attack. My cousin stephen had a stroke at the age of 36. I felt the 
  <br>
  Lord impress on me the next day the scripture from psalm 90:12 &quot;Teach<br>
  us to number our days aright that we may gain a heart of wisdom&quot;<br>
  <br>
  Its a time to really meditate on the promises, dream dreams and take <br>
  whatever steps the Lord leads to make those dreams a reality. </p>
<p>I was going to take the footpath from the middle section of Spa Gill<br>
  Wood towards Aldfield. But I was too busy praying and found myself<br>
  at the main road. A quick section dodging cars before I got to Moor<br>
  Lane [photo 3] which took me into the tidy village of Aldfield.</p>
<p>Across the fields after this towards the Obelisk sat comfortable<br>
  in fellowship with St Marys Church! Sat on the obelisk to enjoy a <br>
  coffee and the first dram of brandy from my hip flask!</p>
<p>Shortly afterwards, on the footpath going towards Studley Roger<br>
  I had the first of a number of close encounters with deer and<br>
  stags! I was quite daring approaching the stag. Read a sign later<br>
  saying that 'for your own safety' do not approach the deer because<br>
  it is rutting season!</p>
<p>Took a right turn towards the lake. Devils chimney was a bit eerie.<br>
  There were two or three little herds of deer each with a single stag.<br>
  These stags stood prominenlty on the steep sides in full view crying<br>
  out. This was presumably a variation on &quot;come and have a go if you<br>
  think you're hard enough&quot;</p>
<p>Once I got the fountains abbey boundary, the great explorer rose up<br>
  in me and I bounded off up the steep forested valley side S of the <br>
  footpath in search of a real close encounter with a stag. I realised later<br>
  that this was quite a moronic thing to do because I had just passed<br>
  the fountains abbey boundary which had an enormous high iron<br>
  fence which was clearly there to keep the deer in..</p>
<p>Anyway I was soon glad that I had 'offroaded' as I was just out of<br>
  sight when I heard this strange humming sound coming W along<br>
  the valley. The humming turned into a hubbub and soon an<br>
  enormous party of prattling pensioners filed past underneath me.<br>
  I'm sure all the stags had run for cover before they got a chance<br>
  to stand en-masse and gawp.</p>
<p>Finally hit the footpath again at the corner of Macjershaw Trough<br>
  and headed W, car-ward.</p>
<p>There was an amusing incident at Hill House Farm. I arrived just<br>
  behind a farm workers quad-bike and closed the field gate for him.<br>
  A dog ran off barking behind him which would otherwise have been<br>
  interested in me. Just as I was leaving the farm area it realised there<br>
  was an unwelcome guest and decided on a bit of intimidation. I<br>
  feigned indifference as it barked at my legs and made it to the <br>
  far gate with no chunks missing. I then saw a party of 4 middle<br>
  aged walkers 100 yards away standing looking at their maps. I<br>
  mischeivous thought occurred to me to warn them off a ravenous<br>
  dog and cut short their walk! I had though better of it and was in <br>
  the process of walking past when this polite lady asked me whether<br>
  the footpath went through the farm. &quot;Yes, through the gate, to the <br>
  right of those farm buildings and past the nasty dog&quot; &quot;Oh, right&quot;<br>
  she replied.</p>
<p>I went my way. This clearly had the desired effect. I looked back<br>
  a couple times and they were still there a couple of minutes later<br>
  trying to pluck up sufficient courage to face cerberus. That done<br>
  there was still time to take a little detour into the woods to the<br>
  W of Robin Hoods Well and have a peek at the abbey through<br>
  the trees.</p>
