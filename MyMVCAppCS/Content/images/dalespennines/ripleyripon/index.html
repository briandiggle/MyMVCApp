<h2><i>Ripley to Ripon </i></h2>
<p><strong>20 December 2004 </strong></p>
<p>Caught the 36 in chapel Allerton just after a bright dawn.<br>
  By the time I'd arrived at Ripley (9:30) it was raining<br>
  and the weather had closed in. The forecast was clearing<br>
up to sunny intervals in the afternoon, so I had some hope.</p>
<p>A good excuse to christen the overtrousers I needed on <br>
  Ben More anyway and found they kept me nice and warm so<br>
  left them on throughout the day.</p>
<p>As it was a Saturday, thought I would avoid main paths<br>
  and so avoided the Nidderdale Way route N out of Ripley<br>
  and followed the FP to Newton Beck which was guarded by<br>
  the herd of cows. The, thanks to the Ramblers, followed<br>
  the Permissive footpath skirting Sir Henry Wood. Here I<br>
  had my first of 3 encourters with people - a local old<br>
  gent with a 'Big Michael Wray' accent walking th'dog.<br>
  Advised me that there were 2 pubs in Markington doing<br>
  food.</p>
<p>Then met up with the Nidderdale Way, passed by one<br>
  runner and his dog. Here the first rays of sunshine<br>
  appeared. I left a marker at the highest point of the<br>
  mornings walk at SE285623 at RH turn in the footpath<br>
  as it first meets Cayton Gill Wood. It is underneath<br>
  the post with FP marker (on the right, looking N) at the turn.</p>
<p>Thinking about these markers, they are reminders for<br>
  me to choose the way of the cross, as the stones point<br>
  E. They remind me to &quot;set my face to Jerusalem&quot; as Jesus<br>
  did.</p>
<p>Just past this point, there is a nice viewpoint looking<br>
  across the Vale of York to the North York Moors.</p>
<p>Steeply down towards Cayton Gill Farm and a meeting with<br>
  some bored horses. Then head NW along a nice enclosed <br>
  valley area. The T junction marks the intersection with<br>
  the Ripley - South Stainley walk I did a while back. I<br>
  follow this until at High Cayton take the FP heading<br>
  towards Hincks Hall. Stopping for a coffee hard boiled<br>
  egg at the second wall I meet, I realise I am ahead of<br>
  schedule for 12noon at Markington. </p>
<p>So skip across to the Bridleway leading to Horse Hill Wood. The sound of Dogs<br>
  barking gets closer and closer and then I come across <br>
  a rather shabby looking kennels with no-one about. Dogs<br>
  with all types of bark are holding a competition. I decide<br>
  to see if I can add my bark in situ. There is a stunned<br>
  silence after my first bark. They start again. I bark.<br>
  Again a stunned silence! Next strange sight is a man with<br>
  a flag at the edge of the wood near Hob Green Hotel, waving<br>
  it at the wood for no apparent reason. Then remembering my<br>
  talk with the landlord at Middlesmoor, realise this guy is<br>
  probably a 'beater'. </p>
<p>This is shortly followed by third strange sight of quick<br>
  succession - a herd of cows chasing two deer down a field.<br>
  Presumable, the deer had breached the cows fundamental <br>
  rights to graze the grass of their field. So this turned out<br>
  to be an interesting diversion. It finished in farce however<br>
  as the 'short-cut' to Markington via FP to the W end of the<br>
  village ended in a farmyard covered in 3 inch deep 'swill'.<br>
  Took some brushing down to make myself presentable for the<br>
  pub.</p>
<p>Turns out that only one pub was offering lunch, and that only<br>
  at weekends- so I was now glad I didnt do the walk yesterday.<br>
The local was almost empty except for a group of locals.</p>
<p>Back out for section 2 of the walk and took Westerns Lane<br>
until the Bridleway on the right. There were now no signs until<br>
I reached Straight Lane. Ingerthorpe Grange (Yorkshire riding<br>
centre) was difficult to navigate. Suffice to say I had explored<br>
fairly well by the time I got out. Just as I was finally figuring out<br>
what track to take out of the complex, a dog began to get<br>
quite interested in my loitering behaviour and began barking<br>
menacingly. It was a case of walking resolutely in the right<br>
direction, maintaining my stride while the dog barked in front<br>
of me. Things then got more desperate when its friend joined<br>
the fun! I continued and after 30 seconds or so of me ignoring <br>
them, they seemed to decide that I was OK and then turned<br>
into my companions, running around me and ahead of me on <br>
the track as if showing the way.</p>
<p>The limit of their domain was reached as we got to the little<br>
  pond on the way to Ingerthorpe Hall, and they went back to<br>
  test out another interloper. Good job, as I now exhibited yet<br>
  more dodgy behaviour. The FP coming in from the South<br>
  just W of ingerthorpe Hall was there clearly - but there was<br>
  only a faintly visible track N with a rope across the entrance<br>
  and a sign saying 'No Access' . After checking the map, I<br>
  ignored the warning and tried to pick up the route of the FP<br>
  as best I could. The local farmer has decided on expanding<br>
  the area of woodland on the map with a conifer plantation.<br>
Past this, locations of previous walls have been moved. All<br>
I had was the map and compass. Kept confidence in myself<br>
and continued, finally finding the exact intersection with <br>
Straight Lane complete with a FP sign (on the other side of<br> 
the stile).</p>
<p>A short section SE caused a disagreement with a true<br>
  rambler. A walker with bottle-bottomed glasses was coming<br>
  the other way and his first words were &quot;are you lost?&quot;. Did<br>
  I look lost? He was more convinced when I told him I was<br>
  on the way to Ripon, and began to describe to me what I<br>
  should have done. In response to this I indicated that there<br>
  was more than one
  way of getting to Ripon, and explained<br>
  the route I was going to take. He then seemed irritated and <br>
insisted that he would get there first!</p>
<p>Just after the little wood on the Left where this meeting<br>
  occurred, I spotted a mountain to climb which promised<br>
  to offer great views. On the map it was Marlow Hill, in the<br>
  middle of a muddy field. Decided to off-road and climbed<br>
  to the highest point, 122m with good views of the Vale of<br>
  York and the North York Moors. </p>
<p>Hurried back down to join the bridleway SW, then swung<br>
  N joining the Ripon Rowel Walk on its way up to Markenfield<br>
Hall. It is a completely moated and fortified Manor House built<br>
in 1310. "This wonderfully little-altered building is the most complete<br>
surviving example of the medium-sized fourteenth century house <br>
in England" - J R Robinson, <em>The Architecture of Northern England </em>. </p>
<p>  I only got a glimpse of it through ugly farm buildings. Its was upon<br>
  to the public for a couple of week in May and June. <br>
  <br>
  My nose for off-road next took me to the disused quarry E of <br>
  the Hall. This was an interesting place with some mostly<br>
  buried carved stone arches. Sat down for a coffee and in the<br>
  quiet could hear the sound of carols. Seemed to come from<br>
  the direction of fountains abbey. Reminded me of the off-road<br>
  experience at Abbott Hall.</p>
<p>Light was now fading as I followed the line of the Ripon Rowel<br>
  up towards Ripon, then followed the southern edge of Ripon<br>
  to meet up with the A61.</p>
