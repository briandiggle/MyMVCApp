    <td><h3>8th Feb 2004<br>
        <br>
        09:30am Hartsop -&gt; Satura Crag -&gt; Brock Crags 11:10am -&gt; Hartsop 
        12:10pm</h3>
      <h3>400m ascent, 4.5 km </h3>
      <br>
        This was a little more of a battle with the elements.<br>
        Snow was lying above about 400m and a strong NW wind<br>
        made for a severe wind-chill.
      <p>I was the third car in hartsop car park today when I<br>
        set off. Didnt see anyone in the vicinity of brock<br>
        crags which somewhat restored the lake district in my<br>
        mind as a place when solitude can be found.</p>
      <p>I was praying about what God had said to me this weekend-<br>
        to delight myself in the Lord. I had stumbled last <br>
        week becoming very discouraged at finding out (big surprise)<br>
        that MVBC is subject to many of the same imperfections<br>
        that existed at NewHope. But I am to delight myself in<br>
        God, not in church. As I delight myself in God, I can<br>
        have vision for a less-than-perfect church and serve<br>
        it with joy and with a heart. If the church itself<br>
        becomes my delight, hope deferred will soon make the<br>
        heart sick.</p>
      <p>Walked up towards the familiar filter house. Around<br>
        hartsop is probably the area of the lakes I now <br>
        know best. Turned to walk directly towards Satura Crag<br>
        on the side of Calfgate Gill. Hard work with the wet<br>
        snow this. Gray crag looks a fine mountain from this<br>
        direction. At the top perched myself in a nook just<br>
        below Satura Crag take a nip of whisky and decided to<br>
        scale Satura. From the top views north included the<br>
        Scottish Southern uplands covered in snow.</p>
      <p>Headed then back towards Brock Crags. The ground <br>
        was a bit treacherous with bogs hidden by snow cover.<br>
        Summit was bitterly cold and I was driven off to take<br>
        cover on the south side with fine views of hartsop dodd,<br>
        gray crag and high street. Left marker on summit.</p>
      <p>I could see some bad weather coming in over loadpot hill<br>
        and thought to myself it would be quite exciting to <br>
        have a snow shower. I was not dissapointed! It arrived<br>
        and I watches as within 10 minutes all the fells were<br>
        completely obscured. I could just make out the shape<br>
        of gray crag. another 10 minutes and the weather passed,<br>
        visability back to 50 miles!</p>
      <p>Ambled back to the car. For once I took it easy all the way!</p>
