      <h2><i>Tarn Crag, Easedale</i></h2>
      <h3>27 December 2000</h3>
      <p>27.12.2000 From Grasmere via easedale, codale tarn</i></h4>Grasmere
-&gt; Easedale Tarn -&gt; Belles Knot -&gt; Codale Tarn (2:30pm) -&gt;
Tarn Crag ridge (3:15) -&gt; Tarn Crag - Grasmere</p>
	<p>I started off at with the idea of doing High Raise by
Pavey Arc but quickly realised that this was too ambitious on one of
the shortest days of the year. So decided on Sergeant Man instead. This
again proved to be too ambitious as by 2.30pm I had only just reached
codale tarn. Walk started in grasmere via the usual route to easedale
tarn, then pressed on quickly up to codale tarn. The tip of Belles Knot
had been beckoning to me since reaching easedale tarn, its' tip the
single point in sunshine in the whole of upper easedale. This is where
I chose to take lunch. Decided here that the only realistic target
today was Tarn Crag in the hour of full daylight left to me. Headed off
for the ridge from Sergeant Man, chasing the falling sun, eager to get
out of the gloom of easedale. By 3:15 had reached the ridge and took my
first picture of the day as the coniston fells came into view.</p>
