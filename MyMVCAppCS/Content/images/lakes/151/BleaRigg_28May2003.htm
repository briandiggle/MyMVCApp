<h3>Blea Rigg</h3>
<p>28th May 2003</p>
<p>Dungeon Ghyll New hotel Car Park 18:25 -&gt; Blea Rigg
19:40</p>
<p>Lovely clear evening. A good time to venture into the tourist<br>
trap of langdale! I saw very few people on this walk though this<br>
was also due to the unusual route I took via Whitegill Crag.</p>
<p>Pretty steep route this was! Took a right turn at the top which<br>
narrowed to a little chimney at the end. Popping my head over the<br>
top the view S suddenly opens up.</p>
<p>Hard work to find the summit cairn! There were three
possibilities.<br>
After having stood on each I decided to place my marker on the <br>
middle one. Weather closed in a little and gave up on Pavey Ark<br>
and headed down via stickle gill</p>
<p>On the way down stickle gill I found a little dell with a
secret<br>
waterfall at which point I decided to answer a call of nature. I noticed<br>
then that the tree in front of me had a plaque. It read "Sarah Wilcock"</p>
<p>Back down to the New Dungeon Ghyll hotel I read go myself a
pint<br>
and sat outside looking across to Lingmoor Fell reading scripture.</p>
<p>I'm at a real point in my christian life where God has
revealed to me<br>
a "path drenched with cream" and yet to walk in it requires great<br>
cost. I want to get there as I know this represents the "rocketing"<br>
spiritually which Yinka prophesied. Yet I see also my old life does<br>
not want to die. Some areas I seem to have the ability to put to <br>
death easily and yet other I cannot. Rees Howells had the revelation<br>
that "self cannot give up self" and saw how God in His grace "pulled<br>
him through" to that higher life. I am now praying that God will<br>
"pull me through" also. Oh God lead me into a life of great<br>
surrender. Help, Holy Spirit! This battle results in times of great<br>
dismay at times. I think most christians only experience the cross as<br>
the place of their cleansing. Here they stay in a life which lacks<br>
power and overcoming. I desire to press on to experience the cross<br>
as my deliverance not from sin only, but the nature of sin, from self<br>
and from my self-will.God help me not to give up!</p>
