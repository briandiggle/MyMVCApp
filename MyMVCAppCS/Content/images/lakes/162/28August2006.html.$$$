      <h3>28th August 2006</h3>
      <p>Chose to escape the crowds if such a thing was possible on Bank Holiday Monday<br />
        in the Lake District! The most out-of-the-way valley - Ennerdale. Not only<br />
      that but the least frequented walk from there.</p>
      <p>And, oh dear, it is out-of-the-way. Driving from Kendal at top speed, with <br />
        clear roads in the early morning, it still took me 1 hour and 40 minutes to <br />
        arrive at the Broadmoor car park. I was weary from the drive upon arrival<br />
        and felt I needed a break before the walk began. I was also somewhat <br />
        deflated to see a stream of gaitered walkers walking along the road to the <br />
      lake.</p>
      <p>I found it rather strange at the time that all these people seemed to be<br />
        walking along the road rather than driving to the car park and starting <br />
        the walk from there. I realised afterwards that these people were very <br />
        likely to be doing the coast-to-coast walk. The first two days of this <br />
        according the AQ book are:<br />
        <br />
        Day 1 <br />
        Travel to St Bees for your first night's accommodation Miles Km <br />
        Day 2 <br />
      St Bees to Ennerdale Bridge 14 22 </p>
      <p>So if people travelled up on Saturday (as is likely) they would arrived<br />
        en-masse at Ennerdale at about 9:30 am on Monday morning having just<br />
        scoffed their Full English in a B&amp;B somewhere near Ennerdale Bridge. <br />
        Imagine it - 2 weeks when you keep bumping into the same people. You'd<br />
        have to approach it as a &quot;get to know you&quot; excercise or it would drive you<br />
      mad!</p>
      <p>So my enthusiasm for a Big Walk was fairly low. I have realised that it is<br />
        not walking itself which I enjoy, but walking with God. I felt really that I<br />
        did the main business with God on Blubberhouses on Friday. Perhaps I need to <br />
        regain a deeper level of intimacy with God so that three days alone with <br />
      Him can be filled.</p>
      <p>I did manage to escape the crowds by heading straight up Grike on a FP<br />
        neither on the map nor in AW. (Through a conifer plantation due to be<br />
        felled soon). As I walked up this I started to pray about Tanzania and <br />
        mission and didnt feel that I was getting anywhere until I felt God was<br />
        changing my focus. Instead of looking for a big &quot;Yes - there&quot; he spoke to <br />
        me about finding my fulfillment in him not in what I do - but in being a<br />
        friend of God. I realised that I had begun to equate personal fulfillment<br />
        with being in the right place and doing the right things. These in <br />
      themselves are not wrong, but my soul must find rest in God alone.</p>
      <p>Approaching Grike I saw to my horror that even in this most unlikely<br />
        place there was a couple just approacing the summit. I turned round and<br />
        found a quiet spot out of sight of the summit and waited there. Looking<br />
        behind I could see that I was being watched from the brow near the summit!<br />
        Yet actually if you studied visitors to Grike over a year period, 11am<br />
        on Bank Holiday Monday in August would one of a handful of busiest moments<br />
        in the whole year on this spot.. Yet I am constrained to do things at the<br />
        same time as everyone else. I look for the feeling of being off the well-<br />
        beaten track  - but here I was taking my place in the queue for the summit.<br />
        It negates much of the sense of wildness and exploration that I come to <br />
      a place like Ennerdale to find.</p>
      <p>After these intrusions though, I saw few people for the rest of the <br />
        day. The same couple were just leaving calf crag on my arrival there.<br />
        I picked up a &quot;oh no its that wierd bloke on his own&quot; vibe so I gave them<br />
      a jovial wave which they were obliged to mirror back to me.</p>
      <p>Then the long trudge over Iron Crag (the summit of which was beyond me due<br />
        to a wall fortified with quadruple barbed wire. This I later discover had<br />
        recently been strengthened to protect sheep grazing of the &quot;Side&quot; to encourage<br />
        the ancient forest there to spread). After this I decided to make my way<br />
        down to the valley avoiding Caw Fell et al. I was glad of this as it enabled<br />
        me to enjoy the highlight of the walk at a slower pace- the Ennerdale Water <br />
        and the remnant of the ancient forest on the Side. This was a delight in <br />
        the evening sunshine, reminding me of my previous evening introduction to <br />
        Ennerdale on the other side of the lake when I had mistakenly tried to <br />
        meet up with Mary at Ennerdale YHA rather than Elterwater YHA - and<br />
      stayed with Bob Orrell at his farmhouse.</p>
      <p>Ennerdale is marred by the enormous conifer plantations planted after the <br />
      1st world war. There is an attempt to reverse this in the &quot;Wild Ennerdale<br />
      Project&quot; See <a href="http://www.wildennerdale.co.uk">http://www.wildennerdale.co.uk</a></p>
      <p>I sent them the following email: </p>
      <p>Rachel,</p>
    <p>I was in Ennerdale over the weekend and was<br />
      very impressed with the work which has been<br />
      done in the valley. I'm glad to see that<br />
      future plans include tackling to ugliness of <br />
      the monoculture conifer plantations which<br />
      mar the vally.</p>
    <p>However I would ask that a more interventionist<br />
      approach is taken to deal with the impact of<br />
      the large areas of conifer in the valley. I<br />
      believe that the temporary impact of felling <br />
      machinery and the visual impact of clearfell<br />
      areas would be outweighed by the longer term results<br />
      which this would provide. Could clear felling<br />
      be speeded up and increased in these areas together<br />
      with planting of native tree seedlings? Seed/<br />
      seedlings from the ancient woodland areas on<br />
      the South shore of Ennerdale water could perhaps<br />
      be used to some extent?</p>
    <p>Regards,<br />
