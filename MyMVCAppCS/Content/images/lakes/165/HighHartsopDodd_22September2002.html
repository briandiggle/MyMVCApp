<p>Only 2.5 hours to fit in a walk, so &lt;2000 ft.
After getting stuck<br>
behind a couch going over kirkstone pass, only had about 1hr 45 mins<br>
daylight to climb high hartsop dodd. Took the footpath next to the inn<br>
at the bottom of the pass, and had to endure walking through a crowded<br>
campsite.<br>
Soon was off the track heading towards the sharp point of high hartsop<br>
dodd as it juts out towards patterdale. It was a lovely late september<br>
evening, absolutely clear, quiet and calm. Shame I was on a tight<br>
timescale really.</p>
<p>On the way up, two markers are the first and second
walls which <br>
are spaced equally. Its a nasty climb and I was very gald to come out<br>
onto the summit plateau. But where was the summit. Two indistinct<br>
humps were candidates. The map gave no clues, so had to turn to <br>
wainwright for the definitive answer of something like "it is <br>
generally agreed that the first rise after reaching the plateau<br>
is the summit". Good thing too, as the second one may have been <br>
too far! The summit was a very small pile of stones, but my <br>
attension was drawn to the view of dovedale which was quite awesome<br>
with the sun setting over Hart crag.</p>
<p><br>
Time for a quick time with the Lord in which I was encouraged<br>
in the major battle I'm in at the moment.</p>
<p>Then, as emily would say after having climbed onto my
knees, 'Down'.</p>
<p>Timimg was about 50 mins up, 35 mins down.</p>
