    <p>A very calm evening, no wind at all. Just a little dull with high cloud.
      </p>
    <p>Took a long way round for the ascent, heading round whiteside end looking
      for the old mining track. I finally found it though it was hardly discernable
      at times and really took me off track into the glacial morraine area between
      sallows and sour howes. I was rewarded with a view of some deer on the
      horizon (fairly close) and the scripture &quot;he makes my feet like the feet
      of a deer- he ables me to walk on my high places&quot;</p>
    <p>Nearing the location of the old mine I came across a badger about 20 feet
      away scuttling to find its hole.Once I had found the mining track a poor
      guide I decided to rely on a guess that striking due N would take me to
      the summit. I was out by only 20 feet!</p>
    <p>It was very quiet on the summit and I had time to spare and prayed that
      God would enable me to really walk in my high places. Left a marker and
      was down by 10:20 still just light.</p></td>
