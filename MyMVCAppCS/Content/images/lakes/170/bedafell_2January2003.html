<p>The wait for a break in the weather was becoming
unbearable! Most of the country was under flood alert. In fact only the
NorthWest had no river flood warnings. I can only assume that this is
because rivers in this area have a greater capacity to deal with large
amounts of rain. </p>
<p>There was a brief break in the rain forecast for today,
so I decided to go for it. After an almost sleepless night and long lie
in I only had half of it left. By the time I'd reached ullswater from
the north the rain had begun again in earnest. After having negociated
the hairpins on the shoulder of hallin fell I realised that I'd left
the map behind. I almost gave it up there until I decided to trust to
wainwright if it was possible. </p>
<p>I'm glad I did carry on as I really enjoyed this walk
even though most of it was done in rain or light snow, it was all out
of the mist. I had a good time with God as we talked about gipton. He
reassured me that I should not search my own heart if it fails because
He's pleased about my obedience. The views were not panoramic maybe,
but they were awesome in a different way. Across boardale all I could
see was the rising slopes of Place Fell, turning gradually from deep
green to white as they rose and merged with the mist, giving only hints
of the massive fell above. Across martindale, High Street gave a
similar grand impression. And there was little Pike-a-wassa which I
climbed with Pete not really knowing where I was in the lakes.</p>
<p>On top of Winter crag I disturbed two swooping birds of
prey, all black with flayed pronged tails. I later was told they were
only ravens!</p>
<p>On past Winter Crag and the rain turned to light snow.
Much preferable as its not wet, and therefore not as cold. It was
fairly pleasant on top of Beda fell where I had a little time to pray
more. Walking on the high ground of the fells seems a natural place to
talk to the Lord about how things are going and look at the big picture
of what is ahead. It reminds me also of the scripture which is
important to me at the moment "He makes my feet like the feet of a
deer, he enables me to walk on my High Places". I'm reminded to always
be hungry to do that.</p>
