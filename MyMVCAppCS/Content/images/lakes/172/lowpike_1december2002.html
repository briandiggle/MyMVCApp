<td>Up in kendal for a long weekend. According to the
forecast<br>
for this weekend, several new lakes were likely to form.<br>
I'd almost given up hope of the rain stopping when there<br>
was an unscheduled break midday on sunday. <br>
Linda was nice about me disappearing and by 2:10 I was<br>
parked up at Lesketh How just past Ambleside (no room at<br>
the inn)
<p>It was a lovely early winter scene which developed as I<br>
climbed out of ambleside towards High Sweden Bridge. The <br>
sun soon disappeared but the lack of rain seemed miraculous<br>
enough!</p>
<p>I followed Scandale Beck up through a section of ancient<br>
forest hugging its' gorge. Once High Sweden bridge was <br>
crossed I felt like I was 'on the fells'. Had a good prayer<br>
time in the early part of the walk before time-pressure<br>
cut in. Feel like I'm back on track in terms of intercession<br>
since during the major battle of Aug-Nov 2002 saw me get out<br>
of the habit.</p>
<p>After taking the first part of the walk at a easy pace,
realised<br>
I'd have to push it to get to my objective. This is where my<br>
delusions began about the identity of Low Pike. I assumed it<br>
was the obvious peak above me as AW descrived it as the 'first<br>
prominent peak seen from the streets of ambleside'. In fact<br>
I was struggling to climb High Pike with only 1hour ascent <br>
time from Lesketh How!</p>
<p>The time factor became more focused by a man coming<br>
down with his two daughters. He clearly thought I was off my<br>
rocker and didnt seem relieved that I was only ascending Low<br>
Pike! His daughter wished me 'good luck' as we parted! After <br>
this I did a bit of fell running through the marshy hollows.</p>
<p>So I reached a peak at 3pm assuming it to be high brock
crags.<br>
Looked at the watch and was getting really disappointed that<br>
I just didnt quite have the time to reach Low Pike.<br>
Began to come to my senses when looking at the map and seeing<br>
the pattern of the stone walls on the red screes side of scandale<br>
beck seemed to indicate that I was near Low Pike. Turned to AW<br>
and the drawing of High Pike from Low pike was a clincher!</p>
<p>After a quick stop on the summit to admire my twice
unexpected<br>
acheivement, turned for home. First spots of rain hit my face<br>
like bullets as I did so. Declared to caradhras that I had<br>
triumphed and she could throw whatever she desired at me in her<br>
anger.</p>
<p>Excitement on the way down was swinging off a branch to
negociate<br>
the last part of High Brock crags (near the Rock Step). Back at<br>
the car in the dark for 3:50pm</p>
