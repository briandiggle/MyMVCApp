<h3><i><br>
Sour Howes, 25th May 2003</i></h3>
<p>set off from Layby before limefitt entrance 7:20pm?<br>
8:37pm at top<br>
Layby before limefitt entrance 9:30pm</p>
<p><br>
As seems to happen often at the moment, I've come away from Leeds<br>
quite down emotionally and spiritually. Emily has not been sleeping<br>
through and Linda's cold persists. I dont seem to have the energy<br>
to get out of the valley and it was this walk which gave me the<br>
hope to climb out again. I almost felt it was happening literally<br>
as I climbed up from Limefitt park.</p>
<p>I lift up my eyes to the hills- <br>
where does my help come from? <br>
2 My help comes from the LORD , <br>
the Maker of heaven and earth. </p>
<p><br>
This so often happens and is why I love to walk alone. Though I<br>
know that there is a great difference between loneliness and solitude.<br>
Solitude is being alone with God and I find that solitude in the
mountains.</p>
<p>Parked in the layby just short of Limefitt park
campsite/caravan park which<br>
was heaving. It even has a pub! Soon left the crowds behind huddled in
their<br>
tents and struck directly for applethwaite quarry with its strange
viewing <br>
platforms. After negotiating a couple of barbed wire fences I was
heading<br>
for the summit. It was a lovely clear, cool evening, the weather having<br>
broken suddenly at tea-time.</p>
