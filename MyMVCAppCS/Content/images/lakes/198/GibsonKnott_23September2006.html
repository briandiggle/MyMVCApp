<h2><i>Gibson Knott </i></h2>
<h3>23rd September 2006 </h3>
<p><strong>Grasmere -&gt; Helm Crag -&gt;
Gibson Knott -&gt; Greenburn -&gt; Grasmere </strong></p>
<p><a href="GibsonKnottA.gpx">A walk GPX file </a>(to
high raise) <br />
<a href="GibsonKnottB.gpx">B walk GPX file</a>
(to sergeant man) <br />
<a href="GibsonKnottC.gpx">C walk GPX file </a>(to
calf crag) </p>
<p>The actual walk was more of a D! </p>
<p>I was expecting to come into this walk greatly
encouraged. The door to the nations is opening. We are about to arrange
a<br />
visit to YWAM Tanzania in November. Dreams long held seem about to be
fulfilled. </p>
<p>Then we share all this with Andy Hobbs. His response is
less than encouraging. Instead of affirming our calling and <br />
seeking to support and back us, we find he has picked up along the way
a quite negative impression of YWAM. "Have<br />
you considered any other organisations?" He then goes on to push BMS.
The meeting is largely taken up with <br />
us defending YWAM unsucessfully. Afterwards I was really discouraged.
Angry that he had no prepared or prayed<br />
at all. He had squeezed in another meeting prior to ours and arrived
late. Shades of that "meeting" about Gipton with<br />
John Sloan. I even found myself saying "you're a very busy man" at the
end as the similarity of the meetings was so<br />
strong.</p>
<p>I prayed that Isaiah 55 will be fulfilled for us:</p>
<p>You will go out in joy <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and be led
forth in peace; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the
mountains and hills <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will burst
into song before you, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and all
the trees of the field <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; will clap
their hands.</p>
<p>I prayed that MVBC and Andy will send us out with
conviction, joy and peace - even with celebration. That<br />
they will commission us in faith and confidence. </p>
<p>This walk was something similar to that. All week lovely
weather had been forecast. Only just before the walk<br />
fog was mentioned as forming in the night, then clearing. So I did the
walk and had to cut it short due to the <br />
poor conditions - cloud at 1700'. Upon descent to greenburn, the
weather cleared up almost immediately as if in <br />
mockery.</p>
<p>The sense of accomplishment was really due to having set
the record for the earliest wainwright ascent at 8:14am on<br />
Helm Crag. This after setting off from Kendal at 6am.</p>
<p>The original plan for the day was in fact Helvellyn via
striding edge, then back via Swirral Edge and Catstycam. I turned<br />
right at Windermere on the Kirkstone Pass road. First glimpse of the
Kirkstone Pass fells showed the mist right down.<br />
I turned round and headed for Grasmere.</p>
