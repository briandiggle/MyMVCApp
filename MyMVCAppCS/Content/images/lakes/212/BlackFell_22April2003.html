<p>This day started out sounding like a walking day on a
methodist<br>
guild holiday! The A party were heading for Dove Crag via Dovedale.<br>
B party going up Blea Rigg. The pathetic C party were scaling Black<br>
Crag. <br>
I joined the C party after seeing the low cloud level. Fancied a walk<br>
through some forest round Skelwith Bridge.</p>
<p>Parked at the Jorysz hotel a.k.a. Skelwith Bridge hotel.
This walk was<br>
a game of two halves. First half was a leisurely (prayerful) walk <br>
skirting the edge of Black crag on two sides. The second half was<br>
a frenzied attempt to get back to the car by 12:30. Not much prayer<br>
took place on the second half but it was fun.</p>
<p>First Half: 09:45 -11:10<br>
Over skelwith bridge. Nursed throught the only finding of the footpath<br>
towards Colwith force (the first footpath sign said "If you're looking<br>
for the footpath to Colwith Force its 100 yards further up the road" <br>
in about that many words!)<br>
Crossed over the minor road to Elterwater and enjoyed walking through<br>
the forest towards the charmingly named "Little Fell" - dappled sun<br>
on brand new bright green beech leaves. Down the lane SE towards the<br>
coniston road. It was about this time that I realised I didnt have<br>
much time to complete the walk. I was faced with the definate prospect<br>
of failing to acheive the 1026' of Black Crag! The rest was a Yomp...</p>
<p>Second Half: 11:10<br>
No time to look at the map. Navigation mistake soon followed. took the<br>
road to Oxen Fell at the junction. Took the next turn correctly and<br>
was soon yomping up towards the Iron Keld plantation. I split the <br>
second half into two 40 minute sections with the summit of Black crag<br>
in the middle at 11:50. By the time I got into the Iron Keld plantation<br>
I realised this wasnt on but was quite enjoying the speed. Left a <br>
couple of overweight middle-aged walkers in my wake. Reached the summit<br>
huffing and puffing at 12:00 and placed a marker.<br>
Now the only way to get to the car for 12:30 was the direct route N<br>
over the feel. Ignored the sign saying access was only to a viewpoint<br>
N and off I went. Some fell running was required while stuffing
sandwiches<br>
in my face. Tried to keep N but the will of the mountain 'turned me<br>
ever Westwards' and I found myself at barbed wire fence at the squiggly<br>
start of the C road at the western end of park fell. Sprinted the final<br>
100M in a time of 9:89 seconds to reach the car at 12:45</p>
