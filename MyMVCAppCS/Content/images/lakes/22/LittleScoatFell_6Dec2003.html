    <td><p>So looking forward to this walk that I managed to get out of bed at 
        7:15am, well before dawn, and set off on the 90 minute journey just as 
        the first rays of the new day could be seen</p>
      <p>By the time I arrived in wasdale, early morning mist had cleared to leave 
        broken high-level cloud with much sunshine. Stopped the car to take the 
        classic wasdale photo and arrived at overbeck bridge CP, the third car 
        in the car park.Yewbarrow looked greate in the morning sunshine. I took 
        my time going up and began to talk to God.Felt the Lord reminded me about 
        the qualities of a knight that He is wanting to work into my life at the 
        moment. These are qualities which are not primarily about skill with weapons 
        but more about having a disciplined and prudent life, a life lived watchful 
        and alert. A lifestyle which has no dichotomy of 'on the field prowess' 
        and 'off-the-field laziness'. </p>
      <p>The Lord then brought my attention to the parable of the workers of the 
        vineyard- how carefully guarded the vineyard was. The vineyard represents 
        my prescious relationship with God. I guess the Lord began speaking to 
        me about this in Lanzarote with the story of samson catching the 300 foxes. 
        Here the vineyard had a wall round it and a watchtower was build. This 
        signifies a constant watchfulness against enemies who would come to 'kill, 
        steal and destoy' within. As my relationship with God is centred on my 
        heart, the heart is also like the vineyard, and here again I was reminded 
        of the pleading of the Holy Spirit with me to 'above all else, guard the 
        heart for it is the wellspring of life'. </p>
      <p>So the Lord is wanting me to develop this watchfulness, this jealous 
        guarding of my heart and of my relationship with him. To ensure that at 
        all times the watchtower is manned properly. If it is not, this is an 
        open invitation for the enemy to attack.</p>
      <p>Then the Lord began to speak to me about diligence, and the abundance 
        that He has provided for me. I remembered the scripture &quot;Awake o 
        Zion,...shake off your dust.. free yourself from the chains on your neck&quot;. 
        He has won the victory and now He says to me &quot;Free yourself!&quot; 
        He showed me that He has prepared a table before me in the presence of 
        my enemies. Yet it is the dilligent who enter in to the abundance of the 
        inheritence. Shockingly the Holy Spirit then spoke to me a scripture from 
        proverbs which I looked up later: &quot;The sluggard buries his hand in 
        the dish, he is too lazy to bring it back to his mouth&quot;. Yet I can 
        see that it is our responsibility to bring to food to our mouths. He will 
        not feed us! He has provided a glorious inheritance, spread a kingly feast 
        before us and invited us to sit down and eat. Diligence enables our souls 
        'to be satisfied with the richest of fare'. For me over the past few years 
        God has opened up the glorious riches of my inheritance in the saints. 
        It is now for me to take hold of it. &quot;We do not want to become lazy 
        but to imitate those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.&quot;</p>
      <p>Up the top of the southern face gully near bell rib I nearly took wrong 
        turn, keeping too far to the right I found myself facing a rock passage 
        maybe 10 inches wide and 6 feet high leading up. I though better of it, 
        skirted to the left, found that I was a the 'great door'. The little passage 
        ended abruptly in a large drop! Moseyed up to the top by 11:30 and had 
        a coffee and some whisky from the hip flask! Marker.</p>
      <p>This is where 1 hour 45 minutes of frenzied activity began as I realised 
        that time was now very short for me to get to Steeple. In one hour I descended 
        off Yewbarrow via Stirrup Crag and reached the summit of Red Pike. Marker 
        (s). Other dram of whisky and I set off, eating my sandwiches out of my 
        fleece pocket, the next objective being Scoat Fell by 1pm to give me a 
        chance of getting to Steeple. Not quite! I got to Scoat fell by 1:15 and 
        decided it was time to take it easy again and pray. Marker. Every man 
        and his dog (literally) was crowding onto the summit of Steeple so I decided 
        to head off into the tranquility of the descent towards the head of Nether 
        Beck. This was lovely. So tranquil and as I enjoyed the solitude Gods 
        presence was heavy on me. This is why I come up here. In many ways I'm 
        searching for this tranquility and the summits themselves become almost 
        meaningless when I find God like this.</p>
      <p>So I took valley of Nether Beck to amble back. After a while I became 
        increasingly drawn to the mass of Middle Fell before me. I began to think 
        about taking a little detour. Did I have time? Yes if I bombed it! Perhaps 
        I should have just ambled back enjoying Gods presence? Anyway it was fun. 
        I decided on a route to tackle Middle fell, and set time targets for the 
        start of the ascent, reaching the initial ridge between Seatallan and 
        Middle Fell and reaching the summit. The tough bit was striking straight 
        up to the ridge next to the first of two streams flowing NE towards Nether 
        Beck. I made time on each of the targets but by the time I got the the 
        final ascent my legs were telling me that this was a little too much! 
        On top at 3:10 for the sunset over the Irish Sea. Marker.</p>
      <p>I had a long way to travel yet as the path down took me away from the 
        car into the next valley, Greendale with a three-mile walk to finish off 
        along the road. It could just see my way to the car.</p>
