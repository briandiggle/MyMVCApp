<h2><i>High Street </i></h2>
<h3>18 April 2003 </h3>
<p>Haweswater CP 11:03 -&gt; East ridge mardale ill
bell (from Small Water) -&gt; Mardale Ill Bell 12:58pm -&gt;
High Street 1:30pm -&gt; Kidsty Pike 1:58pm -&gt; Haweswater CP
15:35pm</p>
<p>Great conditions for this walk in mid-may! Started off
in shorts<br />
and tea shirt. The only downside was that it was quite hazy so could<br />
only see mid-distance. Sunshine all day.</p>
<p>Thought on good-friday in these conditions that I would
have to <br />
choose an out-of-the-way place to avoid the crowds. Half the population
of<br />
the UK had the same idea. Haweswater car park holds about 15 cars. When
<br />
I arrived at 11am cars were parked back from there for about 600M!
People<br />
were arriving all the time. Ah well I decided to accept the crowds and<br />
started towards Small water. Wasnt easy to pray trying to keep people<br />
ahead and behind out of ear-shot!</p>
<p>By the time I reached Small water I was longing to
'off-road'. There<br />
were walkers behind every rock and crevice. Decided to avoid the <br />
motorway to Nan Bield Pass and go up the East ridge of Mardale Ill
Bell. <br />
As I struck off on my own there was the opportunity to wave at one <br />
walker sidling off behind a large boulder for an obvious purpose. He <br />
waved back!</p>
<p>At last I was able to enjoy the fell and talk to the
Lord about wanting<br />
to live in the Spirit. "In his presence are pleasures forever more and<br />
fullness of joy"- nothing the world offers compares.</p>
<p>Had lunch halfway up the E ridge where I found a
triangular stone and<br />
decided on the format of my "marker": Stand at the E side of the cairn,<br />
Walk 5 paces E, place triangular stone here pointing E, having marked <br />
underside of the stone with a cross.</p>
<p>Struck up the virtually non-existent E ridge to hit the
summit exactly.<br />
Surprisingly I had it to myself (for a few minutes) and placed my first<br />
marker!</p>
<p>Now I began the time-trial: Could I get to kidsty pike
and be back at <br />
the car at 3:15? Set off at top-speed towards High Street. In 20 mins<br />
I was there. My dodgy hip wasnt getting in the way much. Just time to <br />
leave a marker and move on my way to Kidsty Pike. Scenery around the <br />
straits of Riggindale was awesome. Reached Kidsty Pike in 25 mins. View<br />
of high street fells was great from the summit. I dont find summits are
<br />
great places to linger when there is a crowd :-(</p>
<p>Off on another romp again taking a short cut from the
crowds to the S<br />
of Kidsty Howes. Detoured round the Rigg finally and back for 3:35pm</p>
