<h2><i>Hart Crag </i></h2>
<h3>25th February 2006 </h3>

<p>16km 973m ascent</p>
<p>Gale force wind at altitude, NE wind with high wind

2400ft. </p>
<p>On descent off Hartsop-above-How, first tree seen at NY
39636 12820, a rowan. Then a holly found at NY 39858 13292.</p>
<p>Planted North American Red Oak in CP at NY 40274 13408</p>
<p>Waypoint for retreat off Hart crag at NY 37040 10870
(746m) </p>
<p>Today I did a great walk - the dovedale horseshoe (with
Middle Dodd and Red Screes) and two think I will remember which I felt
God say:</p>
<p>1. I need to develop a "rythm of running"- to settle
into a running rythm for the long haul. Speaking of spiritual
consistency and reminding me again of the daily discipline.</p>
<p>2. The wind was gale force NE - biting cold. As I looked
over at Little Hart Crag I felt the Lord say to me "find a cleft in the
rock". I could see a place and climbed up and nestled in it to have my
lunch. This was a haven of Spring in the midst of Winter - a true
almost miraculous calm in the storm! I could no longer hear the wind
howling but only the melting of icicles. And I felt the Lord remind me
of the prophecy "..you are literally seeing the hand of God coming and
pushing you inside of Jesus -you are going to be hidden in Him.." Also
was reminded of Ex 34:22 "when my glory passes by I will put you in a
cleft in a rock and cover you with my hand" Then I felt the picture of
Jesus asleep in the boat come to me. This is speaking to me of coming
to a really powerful place in my life literally being hidden in God,
living in Him, in His holiness. This is the secret place of the Most
High where one rests secure in the midst of any storm, untouched by the
elements of the world. The secret place of holiness, of protection in
Him - a walk of His life lived out in His holiness and my life hidden
within. And this is not just a hiding, but a joining - I am joined to
Him, one with His life of power and holiness and this becomes the
nature of the life that is lived.</p>
<p>Other memories of the walk: Sunrise over Gray Crag. Joy
on Middle Dodd. Marker on Red Screes was placed partially under an
overhanging stone -the rock above marked with a + symbol.<br />
Scandale Tarn was beautiful. Marker on Dove Crag was probably a little
loose as the ground was frozen so couldn't bed it in.</p>
<p>Ground on Hart Crag was frozen and snow covered so no
chance of leaving marker there. Hart Crag was Wild! Really felt the
need of crampons as the snow was compacted and slippery. Had the
presence of mind to mark a waypoint at NY 37060 10870 just before the
final ascent of Hart Crag as this would leave a safer route to
Hartsop-above-How if the direct route off rocky Hart Crag proved a bad
idea. Chose to return here rather than taking the direct route off the
summit. Gale force NE winds, snow falling, and the rocky, icy nature of
the summit meant that this was the only sensible option. So I set the
GPS to navigate me back to this waypoint.. I had quickly become
disorientated in the snow, mist and wind and the GPS was pointing to a
direction very different from my "internal compass"!</p>
<p>Descended off the summit to meet a group of what must
have been 50+ people who had skipped the summit on their way round the
fairfield horseshoe. This heightened my sense of acheivement!</p>
<p>Cut across onto the Hartsop-above-How ridge from the
safety waypoint.</p>
<p>Stood on High Bakestones at about 1.15pm aware of a
change in the weather coming inexorably from the NE. From 1pm when the
bank of weather was first spotted over High Street in bright sunshine,
1.25pm saw High Street in mist. It was 5 mins after this that I found
myself also in mist on the summit of Dove Crag. The deterioration was
complete when driving snow arrived on the summit of Hart Crag at 2mp.</p>
