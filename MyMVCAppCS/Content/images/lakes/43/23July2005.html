<p> Wild camping in upper Kentmere! Dipping my toes into the wild camping arena... not sure after having<br>
  tried this that its my cup of tea, or more accurately my mug of lukewarm hot chocolate.</p>
<p>The trek to the campsite was the fun bit. Maybe that says alot! We had to wait for Ross to escape the<br>
  demands of home so arrived at Kentmere Church at 9:15 faced with a yomp up Kentmere. We would have<br>
  to cover 6.5km before nightfall. It proved impossible, particularly with heavy rucksacks. My &quot;world&quot; rucksack <br>
  was dusted down  after a 6 year break since its last adventure in Guyana - still displaying amazonian<br>
dirt.</p>
<p>The light finally failed as we were skirting round Kentmere Reservoir. For the next 30 mins we relied on<br>
  petzl headlamps. My GPS battery failed at the crucial point, leaving us relying on Ross's mountain<br>
  leadership ( ' ML' ) skills. Using bearings, speed and timings we navigated right onto our desired<br>
  spot. Not having had a great chance to look at the location, I now wonder if we camped in the sheepfold<br>
  shown on the map, rather than the old settlement which appears to be set back a little more from the<br>
  river.</p>
<p>I think we missed out on the major plusses for me of camping - seeing a mountain sunset and sunrise<br>
from the mountain. Next morning, the mist was right down. And even if we had wanted to open the<br>
porch for a view down the valley, we'd pitched right behind a stone wall!</p>
<p>Up went the tent with great efficiency. Ross tried to not make too much of his blow-up sleeping mat after<br>
  this. I had the faint sense of injustice that he was &quot;cheating&quot;! He seemed to sleep like a log. I must have<br>
  struggled to get 3 hours of light sleep. The dawn chorus was more a dawn solo by a bird which seemed <br>
  to have taken a great interest our interoping tent. Either that or it was just having a laugh! It warbled<br>
  4 inches away from my ear outside the tent!</p>
<p>Up we got and the day now began to resemble a Duke of Edinburgh exhibition. Packed up our tent. A quick<br>
  breakfast of weetabix in a tupperware container and we were off by 9am.
  Time and again, Ross forged<br>
  ahead pushing the pace for no apparent reason other than a need to get back on time under pain of death.<br>
  We headed straight up the side of a stream towards a gully leading to Thorthwaite Crag, a route wainwright<br>
  described as &quot;tedious&quot;. Here Ross began his habit of forging ahead resulting in the irritating scenario of<br>
  him taking regular breaks waiting for me to catch up, while I could take none. Add to this the drenching<br>
  drizzle rain, cloud down to 1000' and a heavy rucksack continually seeking to pull me off the slope - this was<br>
  a real hard slog.</p>
<p>Once on the 1000' ascent to the gully, Ross suggested I go in front to set the pace. This I did gladly but<br>
  found that within 5 minutes I had once been instructed on the path ahead, and had found him forging ahead<br>
  again. Here I can only assume that the pace I set was not going to keep us on schedule.</p>
<p>Thornthwaite Crag was reached by 10:10am, the beacon looming suddenly out of the mist. It was here that<br>
  my camera signed its own death warrant. It obstinately refused to take a picture of the summit in the light conditions.<br>
  Ross got his camera out and it performed immediately. A digital camera is now top of my required item<br>
  list.</p>
<p>We now began the forced march to Froswick. Here we paused only briefly before picking up the pace again<br>
  towards Ill Bell.
The pace seemed to relax somewhat after this. Our time on Ill Bell was for me the highlight of the walk.<br>
That morning I had asked the Lord to break the cloud when we were on Ill Bell summit. As we approached <br>
Ill Bell I had real sense of anticipation, so strong in fact that I could almost have said to Ross 'wait here <br>
until the cloud breaks'.</p>
<p>And so it did. A shout of excitement came from another walker on the summit as the cloud suddenly<br>
  broke to reveal the valley. Other sections of the cloud continue to break revealing views culminating in<br>
  a hole in the sky being seemingly almost punched above us allowing sunlight to bathe the summit.<br>
  At this point I told Ross about the prayer - I couldn't keep it to myself!</p>
<p>We enjoyed another dose of hot chocolate using Ross's impressive stove and then set off towards Yoke.<br>
  We chose a lunch stop in the dip between Ill Bell and Yoke. Apparently insects gather more on summits<br>
  due to the presence of discarded food .We had a chat about how to make sure that we didnt increasingly<br>
  play &quot;spiritually safe&quot; as we got older, particularly if we get hurt on the cutting edge. We did have a good<br>
  time together.</p>
<p>On to Yoke which was in cloud and back to Garburn Pass and Kentmere church, 20 mins behind schedule<br>
at 2:20pm</p>
<p>I came out of this experience physically and emotionally drained and felt the effects of this for a week<br>
  afterwards. My time away is so precious, time when I am alone with God and He renewes my strength<br>
  and vision. It was hard to drive past Kendal, and the Worm Boot Shop without feeling acutely that this is<br>
  what I really need at this time. </p>
