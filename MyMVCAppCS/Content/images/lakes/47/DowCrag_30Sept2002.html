    <td>Dow Crag
      <p>30th September 2002</p>
      <p>Quite jaded today at the end of a cold, so found this walk a<br>
        bit of a slog. Much of it was in fog which was supposed to clear.</p>
      <p>On the way along coniston kept passing old giffers on endfields<br>
        looking like wallce in leathers. There was some kind of meet around<br>
        the pub at torver. Some of the guys looked ancient, in their 80's,<br>
        red faced, thick glasses, wearing biggles caps.</p>
      <p>Escaped the din opposite the pub. Passed this over-talkative old<br>
        lady picking blackberries along the footpath. Chose to keep away<br>
        from the walna scar highway for as long as possible. </p>
      <p>Trudged up rather slowly, mist was probably about 1500' at most.<br>
        A spurt of energy took me to brown pike. On I went and came across<br>
        a couple eating sandwiches on the next summit and got it into my<br>
        head this was the summit of dow crag. Even took a picture! So was<br>
        rather surprised to find the ground rising again on the other<br>
        side of this summit (buck pike)</p>
      <p>Headed back bia Goats water which was rather eerie. Echoing voices of<br>
        rockclimber could he heard in the clouds on the other side of the water.</p>
      <p>And if it didnt clear up as soon as I was down...<br>
