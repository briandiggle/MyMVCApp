<td>Decided that it was high time I got to know the
mountains and valleys closest to kendal better. Started the day with a
plan A and plan B. Plan A was
to &nbsp;climb Kentmere Pike via Steel Rigg and then loop round to
Gatescarth
pass taking Harter Fell on the way. Plan B was Sallows and Sour Howes
if the
weather was bad.
<p>By the time the final decision was made I was onto about
plan G! Parked at Sad Gill in sunshine but was dissappointed to see
that there was mist at about 2000' at the head of Longsleddale. I was
glad to get anything
in today really with worries about my left eye being up to it. But it
greatly improved on Sunday. A pulled muscle in my right leg was nearly
right but there was a doubt over how it would stand up to a big walk.
In the event it wasnt a problem.</p>
<p>Started off up Sad Gill talking to the Lord about the
future. A break in the pressure of work has given me time to think more
about our long term plans. It has though been difficult so far this
year to keep focused and free from fear as worries about the eye have
persisted. It is a real
&nbsp;battle against fear. It's been encouraging to see how Linda
has seen a real breakthrough in this area recently and has supported me
to overcome the giant of fear in my own life.</p>
<p>She also felt God say recently that promises about
missions place us in the shoes of Abraham who was strengthened in faith
and gave glory to God because he believed the promises even though he
knew his body was as
good as dead. That is our position - in the natural going as a family
into
mission is so out of the pattern of our lives right now. But we must
believe and encourage ourselves in the promises also. This confirmed
just what
God had said to me after emily arrived. I am living now in the
fulfillment
of all Gods promises of being married and being a Father. I inherited
those promises by faith. Now I must do the same with the second great
faith challenge of my life - our calling to mission.</p>
<p>Today became an example of the life of walking by faith
and an encouragement that to those who trust, God is faithful to his
promises. That seasons
change quickly, like dry river beds in the Negev suddenly filled with
water.</p>
<p>Walking up Backbarrow Crag I thought I remembered
reading in Wainwright that the Steel Rigg route should not be attempted
in mist. A quick check
confirmed this. Plan C was then hatched - Tarn Crag and Grey Crag on
the other
side of Longsleddale were as yet clear of mist. Climb them starting a
Brownhowe
Bottom.</p>
<p>As I climbed towards this I began thinking that with all
the time I had, more could be accomplished. So Plan D became Plan C
plus branstree,
going E from the head of Gatescarth pass.</p>
<p>I was walking along the gatescarth pass byway above Wren
Gill when the &nbsp;weather suddenly closed in. In the space of 5
minutes, from being able
to see all of the East side of Longsleddale and the enclosed valley, I
was
in mist and the only familiar feature was the byway! As wainwright
warned &nbsp;against Tarn Crag in mist, plans C and D were dead!
Enter plans E,F and
G...</p>
<p>Plan E was to follow the line of the fence E from the
head of Gatescarth Pass to Branstree and retrace my steps. Plan F was
to follow the fence W of
this point taking in Adam Seat and Harter Fell then retracing steps.
Plan G was plan F but continue after Harter Fell along the fence and
take in Kentmere Pike and Shipman Knotts. </p>
<p>I arrived at the pass. The wind was whistling past with
a fearful windchill. I took a deep breath and headed W towards Adam
Seat. This is where I
began to walk by faith! The conditions were nasty. Ice had formed in
the
direction of the wind on any obstacle in its path. There were some
wierd
formations on the wire fence and tall grass. I soon had to protect
myself as much as &nbsp;possible from the wind with the kagool
leaving just a small gap through
&nbsp;which to see.</p>
<p>I relied for peace of mind on the compass and map,
referring to them &nbsp;often. Arriving at what I thought was adams
seat I was saw on the map &nbsp;the symbol BS. Had some fun opening
up the map to find the meaning of this symbol - Boundary Stone. Sure
enough there was an ancient erect stone on which was carved the symbol
'L'. Continued up towards Harter Fell passing through some snow fields.
Came across the first wierd
cairn of Harter Fell with its nightmarish quality. Pressed on towards
Harter Fell encouraged by another correctly located Boundary Stone,
this time
inscribed with an 'L'</p>
<p>After stopping briefly at the summit of Harter Fell I
decided to go for Plan G! It was a long walk along the top towards what
I knew should be kentmere pike. I had soon lost my sense of direction,
relying on the
compass completely, checking regularly that I was on track by
confirming that
the fence was swinging round towards a SE direction. Still after so
long relying entirely on the map and compass, doubts start to creep in.
Fear grows even though you're sure that , according to the map, you're
right
on course. I was a relieved when the ground began to swell again,
presumably towards Kentmere Pike summit. The cairn and OS column
confirmed that I was still OK. </p>
<p>Just before reaching the summit I had a short sense that
the gloom had &nbsp;brightened a little. I stopped dead and wheeled
round to where I
thought the light was and thought I could detect something. This
happended a few
times.</p>
<p>Settled down to lunch on Kentmere Pike. It happened
again - a chink of
light in the howling gloom! Then a definite white path came and went.
Suddenly a bright expanse of sky appeared...I jumped up. In a few
moments an awesome vista opened up - a caught a glimpse of a mountain
ridge on
the other side of the wall and began to shout for joy! The mist then
broke
into ribbons and all was revealed. It happened so fast...</p>
<p>It took me a while to orientate myself. What I initially
thought was ullswater or thirlmere I realised was Windermere. The range
I first saw was the
Western side of Kentemere - Yoke, Ill Bell and Froswick. </p>
<p>Finally I set off towards Shipman Knotts in sunshine.
Took a quick detour to Goat scat to inspect it after its foreboding
display this morning. On
shipman Knotts I decided to build a better cairn. Hopefully cleared up
a bit of
confusion by removing a large stone from the southern most grassy knoll
and placing it on the middle (highest) one.</p>
<p>Back down to Sadgill via Sadgill wood where I lingered
for a while before crossing the bridge over the Sprint. To my delight
as I did this, the
first drops of rain began to fall!</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Footnote 8 November 2009:<br /></span>We
are moving onto lifes plan C after seeing the&nbsp; "second great
faith challenge of my life - our calling to mission" not work out due
to the mess of WEC Senegal. Might life's journey end up at Plan G?
