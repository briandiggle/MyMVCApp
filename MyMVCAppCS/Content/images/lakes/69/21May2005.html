<h2><i>Seat Sandal </i></h2>
<h3>21 May 2005 </h3>
<p> Mill Bridge, Grasmere 11:50 -&gt; Seat Sandal 13:45 -&gt; Grizedale Tarn 14:15 -&gt; Glenridding 16:15 </p>
<p>Up in kendal for a weekend with emily I was planning<br>
  when I could squeeze a walk in but Mum second guessed<br>
  and had one of her &quot;good ideas&quot;- why not walk &quot;through<br>
  the gap&quot; and be picked up in Glenridding. I bit her hand<br>
  off but planned to make a slight diversion to Seat Sandal.<br>
  As I was set down at Mill Bridge, a quick negociation gave<br>
  me an extra half-hour and I had four hours and ten minutes<br>
to do the walk instead of the 3.5 hours bernard takes.</p>
<p>So off I went straight up the side of Seat Sandal I have<br>
  looked at dozens of times from grasmere. The weather was<br>
  a treat as well, with heavy showers predicted, there was<br>
  no mist and only a few drops of rain.</p>
<p>I needed this break to get thinking clearly again. There<br>
  is so much (too much) pressure on at home and I have<br>
  really felt the need of a break for some time. Yet I'm<br>
  aware that 4 hours isnt really enough. Talking to Pete<br>
  yesterday- he has a yearly retreat to the Lakes for 3/4<br>
  days and on the first day he often finds his head is<br>
  still buzzing with all the life of home. I think I <br>
  was in that place really still at the end of the walk -<br>
  refreshed but not really fully back on track. </p>
<p>I felt what God was emphasising was that I must press<br>
  in will all energy to &quot;lay hold of that for which Christ<br>
  Jesus laid hold of me&quot;. I came to Him first with the<br>
  heart cry &quot;I just want to be free&quot; and His response was<br>
&quot;lay hold of me and you will be free indeed&quot;. There<br>
  was a burden to press in to experience the &quot;glorious <br>
  liberation of the children of God&quot;. It is not Gods<br>
  heart that I merely &quot;control the flesh&quot; but that I<br>
&quot;put on Christ&quot;. I am in a battle of deliverance at<br>
  present and must press through.</p>
<p>I met a total of two people on Seat Sandal and am<br>
  convinced that the sparcity of people was partly<br>
  due to today Cup Final! I had the summit all to <br>
  myself and placed the marker (Note 5 paces from<br>
  estimated centre of cairn) 
  before descending <br>
  steeply to grizedale tarn where I joined the <br>
  relative A road of traffic. Though in truth there<br>
  were still few people about it was enough to make<br>
  me seek refuge by walking down grizedale on the <br>
  opposite side to the main path.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the place where a path crosses<br>
  over the stream I was &quot;up against the clock&quot; and <br>
  yomped the last 45 minutes. Raced up to lanty's<br>
  tarn it coming into view at exactly 4 o'clock <br>
  (the agreed meeting time).</p>
<p>The last treat of the day was walking through the <br>
  sea of bluebells in flower on the fell side taking<br>
  their turn of prominence before the bracken overshadowed<br>
  them for the rest of the summer.</p>
<p>Joined a Pendlebury family tradition of a pot of tea<br>
  at the &quot;Greystones Cafe&quot; in Glenridding. It was great<br>
  to walk down the final stretch into Glenridding and<br>
  see emily in the distance walking along the stream<br>
  wall outside Greystones.</p>
