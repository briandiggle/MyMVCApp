<h2><i>Pike O'Blisco </i></h2>
<h3>26 Nov 2005 </h3>
<p> My second stab at an eXtreme lakes experience! This one
a little wilder than the Kentmere camp. As we approached the weekend
the weather forecast was littered with severe weather warnings and
things looked pretty nasty. </p>
<p>Still we decided it was now or much later so went ahead
with a slightly less ambitious plan of finding a campsite just off the
floor or the Langdale valley. Plan A had been to drive up to Hardknott pass
and camp half-way up Cold Pike.</p>
<p>The moment we came when I stepped out of the warm car at
the head of Langdale and set my face to complete this challenge. I knew
it was going to be a rough experience, but having steeled
myself for this I felt some exhiliration as we strode off into the
darkness in search of our site. Almost immediately, the will of
Caradhras was set against us. The wind got up and hail was in our
faces. </p>
<p>Strode through Stool End (lovely name) and past the
farmer who simply ignored us and up towards "the Band". Ross's plan was
to look for a campsite just above the little wooded area hear the
intake wall. We skirted around the top of this area but found it to be
fairly sloping. One area just inside the wood was flat but too
rocky. So retraced our steps to a site we'd passed up previously as
being a little sloping and settled for this as the best
available option.</p>
<p>Up went the tent. I was not getting fairly cold with the
wind chill and was glad to get in. The night was a repeat of the
Kentmere camp with Ross sleeping soundly. I spent most of the night
trying not
to roll on top of him. In the middle of the night we were distured by a
sheep who seemed equally disturbed that we were there. It
was bleeting in a most distressed manner just outside the tent and
seemed to be asking permission to join us inside. It
finally gave up. Next morning there was a lone sheep lingering around
the camp area - probably the same one!</p>
<p>The weather was no better the next day. In fact the rain
was persistent throughout the entire period of the expedition! We
decided against the Crinkles as we could see that snow was lying at high level.
The days' target was Pike O' Blisco which was destined to become the first Wainwright to have been climbed three times. It
reached that distinction throught the chance decisions of &nbsp;others rather than the direction of my own will.</p>
<p>We'd just got going, reaching the FB crossing Oxendale
Beck when we stopped for 20 minutes for the absolute necessity of
taking water from the Beck, boiling it and storing it in a container.
The 1.5 litres of water which I had was ample for both of &nbsp;us in
reality. He does take this ML stuff rather seriously at times. </p>
<p>There was an ongoing, unspoken tension between us in the
matter of altitude readings which simmered away through the whole
&nbsp;time and came to a head on the summit! Ross had brought his new
pride
and joy - a flash (mechanical) barometer/altimeter! On numerous
occasions he would study it and then state sagely that the
pressure was doing this and that so the weather would do this and that
at some unspecified time in the future. The altitude
would also be read out with the confidence of one stating immutable
fact. However this immutable fact didnt always get as close
as my GPS to the OS MAP altitude. The acid test, I thought, would be
what the two rivals would tell us on the summit of Pike
O'Blisco, shown as 705m on the map.</p>
<p>We raced up the mountain. Ross seems to like treating
climbing as aerobic exercise, pushing himself against the clock.My
atitude is somewhat different. If I break out into a sweat, its time to
look for an appropriately flat rock, sit down, and enjoy the view. The
result of our contrasting approaches is the repeatedly Ross strikes out
ahead, I plod along losing ground to him, he stops to wait for me then
sets off again when I catch up. Groundhog day starring the
Hare and the Tortoise.</p>
<p>Anyway, we reach the snowy summit. I reach for my GPS
and, hardly able to contain my glee, annouce that it shows an altitude
of 702, only 3 metres out. I dont get to hear the reading from the
altimeter but do get treated to Ross's response- "So What!"</p>
<p>From this point on, the walk became eXtreme. The path
off the summit we took headed in the direction of Bleaberry Knott
&nbsp;initially and took us, without option, over two rather nasty
10-12 rock
climbing pitches. I've never had to do anything like this in the lakes
before. I guess its a route that didnt even get into
Wainwright. Clear route it was though. Add the falling snow, ice rocks
and 30 mph winds and this was no walk-in-the-park. Ross went
down the first pitch putting his rock climbing skills into practice and
then guided me down. I didnt feel particularly
comfortable, mostly because I was doing this with my pack on and felt
it was pulling me off. I guess it puts the failure of Puig
Caragoler to bed though. The next pitch was easier as I handed my
rucksack to Ross before going down.</p>
<p>Things were back to sane lakeland standard after that.
We yomped the rest of the path down Redacre Gill, pounding our joints
on the horrible rock staircase. I must admit to really disliking
these constructions. They are really hard work on the legs and give the
walk a monotonous plodding sort of feeling.On my own
I may have avoided the steps entirely and 'Off-Roaded'. We both
abandoned them anyway after having slipped - ice
had formed dangerously on them.</p>
<p>The challenge was over. Back into the air conditioned
car. I'm more convinced than ever that camping and rain dont <br />
go together. It was fun, but exausting. For me, not an experience to
recharge batteries but rather to run them down. </p>
