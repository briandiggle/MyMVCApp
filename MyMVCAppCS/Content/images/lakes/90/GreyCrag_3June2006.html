<p>As the rain had beaten the ground for the previous two
days almost non-stop, I was giving up hope of climbing anything on this
trip to kendal. Suddenly the rain stopped, and by the time I reached
hartsop car park there was hardly a cloud to be seen.</p>
<p>I was looking for solitude today. Not loneliness, but
being alone with God revelling in His awesome creation. And I chose the
right place- everyone seemed to be on the main road to high street,
which I quickly turned off and struck straight up the summit ridge.
Views back to ullswater and surroundings were great, especially as I
now feel like I know this part of the lakes pretty well. </p>
<p>I had the summit plateau to myself. I raised my hands to
God at the summit as I was praying. Theres so much I want to learn
about the surrendered life, walking in the footsteps of the precious
Holy Spirit. But how quick I am to stumble. Teach me to do your will O
God, Let your good Spirit lead me on level ground.</p>
<p>This time I made sure that I took time to enjoy the walk
more and experience the beauty around me, rather than living too fast
in the pursuit of acheivement (could I have got to threshwaite mouth?!)</p>
<p>Went down a slightly different way walking off right
towards the end of hayeswater, but here I struck the crowds so didnt
linger there on my way down. Back for emilys tea!</p>
