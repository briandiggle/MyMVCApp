      <p>The only walk managed in this period of intense activity in preparation for mission. Shortly after
this walk I had a very nasty virus, the third in the last two months - an indicator the pressure I have been
under recently. </p>
<p>An attempt to place a marker in the centre of the grass summit was going well until a fell-running
suddely appeared as if from nowhere and took a keen interest in what I was doing. Once I had made it
clear that he should mind his own business, he continue. Lesson learnt though- stick to the rules
of placement and things work better. This I did afterwards and left a small marker in the usual place.</td>
