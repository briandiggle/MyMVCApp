<h2><i>Ashstead Fell from Hucks Bridge </i></h2>
<h3>28 December 2009</h3>Average Speed: 1.2 km/h<br />Maximum Speed: 8.6 km/h<br />Minimum Speed: 0.0 km/h<br />Total Time: 03:01:29<br />Cartographic Length = 3.647 km<br /><br />Conditions:
8 inches of snow was left from the heavy falls before Christmas. The
top layer was frozen but was normally unable to support my weight. No
wind, excellent visability.
<p> Five weeks ago I braved the torrential rain to climb the first peak
on the Northern side of the Borrowdale valley. It was the worst floods
in living memory taking place just after we arrived back from Senegal.
Then I was fresh from the escape out of that impossible situation.</p><p>Today,
about a month later,&nbsp; I walked the first peak on the Southern side
of the valley in conditions caused by the worst snowfall in the lakes
for at least ten years. I was aware of how much I have travelled
internally since then, how the Lord has brought me along and spoken to
me. I came to this walk with a much clearer and more confident mental
attitude, feeling ready for the next challenge - to make a new start in
Leeds at the beginning of a new era of my life. The post-mission phase
where dreams of serving the Lord overseas are not dead by definitively
on the altar waiting for God to provide a ram. Dreams now must be
(perhaps as they should always have been) about the person I want to be
in God rather than the things I want to do for God. There is still
though a hunger to serve him meaningfully and extend His Kingdom which
right now I dont know what to do with.</p>Though I am faced imminently
with return to all that is familiar, this walk was anything but. I have
never walked in such alpine-esque conditions. Thick snow,clear air,
long vistas. It was a new experience of winter mountaineering that has
whetted my appetite for more! <br /><br />The first 10 minutes of the
walk were rather irritating as I was trying to get to grips with the
use of crampons. The crampons first came off as I was crossing the A6,
after which I realised that the strap needs feeding not just round but
underneath. They came off again shortly after leaving the road when I
was passed by two smug walkers without crampons who had just finished
the full Borrowdale round! Anyway on reflection it was worthwhile
wearing them as, though they were cumbersome, they did ensure a good
grip at all times.
