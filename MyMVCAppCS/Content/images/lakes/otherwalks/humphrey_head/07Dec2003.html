    <td><p>My legs were not willing to undergo a repeat of yesterdays torture 
        so I was looking for an easy option without any real ascent! Humphrey 
        head is I think the lowest peak in the 'outlying fells of lakeland'. It 
        surrounds have many memories. The walk started with blasting out 'Oh God 
        you are my God and I will ever praise you'. A song which speaks to me 
        now of promises fulfilled and hope for the promises which remain. Quick 
        look at the 'beach' across the track. Scenes of battles against the tide 
        when staying at abbot hall, it is now grass and mud. Most of the rock 
        have been swallowed up. How faithful God has been to bring to me this 
        place now - a husband and father!</p>
      <p>Set out along the headland took a coffee round the corner from Kirkhead 
        End ont he railway embankment. Read againt the story of how God took Abram 
        out to show him the night sky. It struck me that He was not only asking 
        Abram to count the stars, but also to consider His awesome power, the 
        glory of his creation. And as Abram consider this, he believed that the 
        One who made the universe by his power and great understanding could also 
        fulfill his promise to Abraham to give him an heir from his own body. 
        I also think of the promises upon my life now and am greatly encouraged.</p>
      <p>My meditation was rudely interrupted on the path past Wyke farm. The 
        sun was directly ahead dazzling my eyes. The ground seemed untrustworthy. 
        One step ahead and to the right and I would be in the shade of Wyke Farmhouse 
        and be able to see the ground ahead. That was one step too far! In an 
        instant I had disappeared to my knees. I'm thankful now it was not deeper. 
        I grabbed the side and pulled myself out. I was covered in some unholy 
        mixture of mud and manure! Sat down for another coffee and decided to 
        soldier on.</p>
      <p>Soon found myself at Humphrey Head with great sea-scapes. Decided for 
        a spot of 'off-roading' on the way back. Struck off directly for the tower 
        on the hill above Abbot Hall. I remember once doing the walk legally from 
        Abbot Hall but now the path seems to have fallen into disrepair and the 
        tower little frequented. Also found what seemed like a makeshift tree-house 
        on top. On the way down I saw a deer before walking through the grounds 
        below the house. Couldnt see the putting green, scene of many great victories 
        over old ladies. Past the knarled old tree at the end of the main lawn 
        and resisted the temptation to climb.</p></td>
