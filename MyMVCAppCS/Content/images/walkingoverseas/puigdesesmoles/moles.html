  <p>The plan was<br>
  to head for the pass of Coll Cuiro and then make an assault on <br>
  the summit 1000' above from there. Due to the poor nature of the<br>
  map (contours at 50m intervals) I wasn't able to tell if a route<br>
  was possible from the pass in advance. The only hint I had<br>
  was a walk summarised on a spanish web site which suggested that<br>
there was a route which someone had taken before.</p>
<p>Woke up at 6:30 and looking outside I was disappointed (?) to<br>
  discover a clear sky. It was already warm outside. I found out<br>
  the next day talking to the owner of a local vineyard that this<br>
  had been the hottest day of the year so far at 34.8 degrees</p>
<p>Arrived at the tiny parking space at Mosset at 7:30 (room for<br>
  two cars max), donned my &quot;pico redondo&quot; hat and set off walking<br>
  towards Femenia Nou through pine forest on a decent track.<br>
  Lovely and Quiet except for a shepherd somewhere in the valley<br>
  shouting at his flock.</p>
<p>From Femenia Nou the views down into pollensa were panoramic.<br>
  An idlyllic scene - the farmhouse perched on a terrace of the<br>
  tramantuna mountain rage overlooking most of North-West mallorca.<br>
  Pico de Maria/Santuari near pollensa was there and somewhere <br>
  just behind that- our finca and pigs.</p>
<p>Approaching Femenia Vell the way was barred by an unchained<br>
  (sleeping) dog. First opportunity for off-roading turned out<br>
  to be a clever short-cut. The dog never woke up from its <br>
  slumber! On past femenia vell I came to a terrace on the <br>
  hillside on the right of the path and went to explore and<br>
  take a break. From here Puig Massat and Puig Gros de Ternelles<br>
  were very evident. The land towards the sea looked wild and<br>
  pristine.</p>
<p>The track up towards Coll Cuiro afforded good progress so that<br>
  by 9.00 I was nearly at the Coll. Thinking I was making <br>
  wonderful progress, I decided to add another peak which was<br>
  beckoning to the right of the pass - Puig de Ses Moles 736m.<br>
  This turned out to be an hour-long diversion as the peak I<br>
  was aiming for was a sham - the real summit was set back<br>
  a considerable way. </p>
<p>At the summit, great views of the North West. Formentor was <br>
  behind the bulk of Ternelles. Puig Tomir loomed to the South <br>
  (glad I didnt attempt this). I found what looked like a <br>
  nativity scene in one of those old chemists medicine bottles. <br>
  It had decayed somewhat but the crib and other extras were there. <br>
  Then I noticed a 35mm film canister and thought that I had<br>
  found a micro-cache by chance. It turned out to be a personal<br>
  micro-cache left by someone in Feb 1997. 8 years later it was<br>
  still in great nick.</p>
<p>Left a marker without a mark. The pen knife which would have<br>
  been helpful at this point caused alot of interest at Palma airport<br>
two days later... The marker was left 5 paces east-ish from the<br>
summit cairn directly on the line to the summit of <br>
P. de Maria/Santuari near Pollensa town.</p>
<p>Back to the pass and the next task was to find a way up <br>
  onto the summit plateau. The were two mountain shelves I had<br>
  to scale. From a distance, the first shelf looked to have a<br>
  weakness to the right. The second shelf looked to have a <br>
  somewhat more dubious weakness to the left. As to whether<br>
  a path exists on top of the first shelf leading to the <br>
second weakness was anyones guess.</p>
<p>The first one proved to be easy - just a single five foot<br>
  section of rock climbing with handholds. And there turned<br>
  out to be an easy path to the second weakness. However<br>
  as I approached the second weakness, it became increasingly<br>
  evident that this was no push-over! It was a ten-foot section<br>
  of sheer vertical rock with even as slight overhang. I gave<br>
  it a go - but this was REAL rock-climbing! The handholds <br>
  required finger-strength. The footholds were more toe-holds.<br>
  I clung on half way up, wondering what to do. A final 'go'<br>
  persuaded me to give it up. I leaned and stretched forward,<br>
  grabbing hold of a better handhold, placing myself in a <br>
  more 'committed' position. Then the handhold moved! I<br>
  retreated, my heart pumping! After this I was more than<br>
  happy to settle for Puig De Ses Moles.</p>
<p>There was an area of easy cultivated ground round the corner<br>
  frm the Coll Cuiro which lulled me into thinking this was<br>
  going to be easy. The next 2.5 hours were anything but- <br>
  fighting my way through a tangled mass of rocks and thick<br>
  vegetation. The area between Coll Cuiro and Coll des Pinetans<br>
  was a morass of sharp rocks and think vegetation. By the end<br>
  of the walk my legs had numerous lacerations.</p>
<p>The going became a little easier from Coll Des Pinetans as <br>
  the path was cairned. Walking now was a case of looking for<br>
  some stones poking out above the mass of rocks and vegetation<br>
  which appeared to be man-made - and heading for it. Then the<br>
  next.. </p>
<p>The area felt like the &quot;dark side of the moon&quot;. Add to this<br>
  the now stifling heat, no shade and lack of any wind. I got through<br>
  nearly 3 litres of water. The cooler pine forest of the other<br>
  side would have been welcome.</p>
<p>As I approached Coll des Ases and found the first Pine tree<br>
  for about three hours. This represented to me a return to civilisation.<br>
  This really was the closest I have been to a real wilderness in<br>
  my life. I felt an edge of anxiety at the starkness of the <br>
  terrain which took the edge of my usual carefree enjoyment of<br>
&quot;the fells&quot;. Thus I didnt revel in the experience as I had done<br>
  in Lanzarote. Yet I know that my heart was not alive as it had<br>
  been there. The book I'm reading at present talks about the need<br>
  for men to rediscover their hearts, and to do that you need to <br>
  head for the wilderness. I think there needs to be for me a certain<br>
  level of confidence and familiarity with the experience and environment<br>
  in order to allow mental space for &quot;deeper thinking&quot;. And probably<br>
  alot more time. Here there was also the pressing need to get back on<br>
  time or make Linda fearful.</p>
<p>Coll des Ases has a Pine tree at its summit. Here I sat down facing<br>
  back inland and felt that I had &quot;come out of radio silence&quot;. Now<br>
  I relaxed and could pray again. Before this there was no room in <br>
  my head for thoughts higher than &quot;where is the next pile of stones?&quot;<br>
  Soon I was greeted with another sure sign of mans nearness - the<br>
  gentle clanging of a &quot;goat bell&quot;</p>
<p>The highlight of the remaining time was the picturesque farm of<br>
  Mossa with its wheat fields literally white for harvest, and the<br>
  knarled ancient olive-trees dotted about in the fields like old<br>
  ents walking.</p>
<p>Finished off with a nasty bit of &quot;off-roading&quot; cutting off a <br>
corner to the closed section to mossa farm.</p>
