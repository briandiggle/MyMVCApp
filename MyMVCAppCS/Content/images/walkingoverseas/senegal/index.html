<p><em>1. </em><em>The front entrance to Ecole Maristes, the large
catholic school. This taken when the mad rush for 8am had dissipated.
Behind the photo, a taxi "rank" was situated where I would triumphantly
walk past a taxi driver who knew I was walking to Patte D'oie. This was
my favourite part of the day - 30 minutes to think and pray as I walked
before arriving back at no56. It was too hot to do the walk to school
at 2:30 until november.<br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_1.jpg" /></em></p>
<p><em>2. Side street. The end of this street always had a security
guard sat on the Right and another guy sat listening to the radio on
the left. They were there at 8am and at 3pm, always the same!</em><em></em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_2.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>3. </em><em>The "scenic" part of the walk as I went along next
to the inland lake. Suddenly all was very quiet, the noise of traffic
had gone. A little further on, there was a korean family in a large
house. The old lady of the house would often be sitting outside on a
plastic chair. Next door in an undeveloped plot there was a wooden
shack in which lived a man with two wives and numerous children.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_3.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>4. </em><em>Just past the Korean house, the road now passes
under the line of pylons, also marking a line of undeveloped land used
for cultivation. I would often see a labourer crossing the road with
two full watering cans from the lake, taking the water the irrigate his
little plot. </em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_4.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>5. Passing under the line of pylons, I had to pass one of the
neighbourhood rubbish tips. Assorted household waste would be dumped
here and smell until someone (I know not who) came and burnt it all ,
releasing acrid fumes.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_5.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>6. </em><em>Some new rubbish (sifted for anything useful) and previous burnt rubbish to the left.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_6.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>7. If only it worked!</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_7.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>8. </em><em>Turning away from the inland lake towards Patte
D'oie. The gouge in the middle of the road is evidence of the damage
done to the roads by the rains</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_8.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>9. Walking alongside the second inland lake. Further up at a
crossroads, a disabled woman was already on duty in her wheelchair.
Each day she was there and by her constancy her presence and need
slowly grew in my consciousness. This how she would build up over time
a list of "clients" who would know where to find here if they felt the
need to give alms. </em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_9.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>10. Going up the "steps" to the autoroute. This was fun the day
it rained a couple of weeks before. Next to this, there was a street
barbers shop with a hand-painted alien who had received a cut there.
This bit of the walk was officially illegal, and twice I had to take a
longer route to go over the passerelle when there was a traffic
policeman here.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_10.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>11. </em><em>Crossing over the autoroute. This is the newer section leading to the payage in contruction.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_11.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>12. Entering the allotments area after the autoroute was
crossed. The path leading through was covered in detritus but to either
side there was green. A well was just ahead, often with a horse and
cart parked while the horse drinks some fetid water. Just here there
was also a place where clay pots were molded in the ground before being
taken out to dry in the sun.</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_12.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>13. </em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_13.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>14. </em><em>Finally at the end of the alottments, Cite Al Amal
comes into view. First I must cross the local rubbish tip. The cause of
the acrid fumes which often bothered Linda. Another fire is burning on
the left. Just before entering the cite, there was a shack shop
advertising "deratisation"</em><br />
<img style="border: 1px solid ;" src="DA_To_56CiteAlAmal_28October2009_14.jpg" /></p>
<p><em>15. </em><em>Walking up towards the mosque. On the left just
before this was the building site where the more breathing space was
disappearing forever. Each day I would note progress. Then a left turn
towards home.</em><br />
