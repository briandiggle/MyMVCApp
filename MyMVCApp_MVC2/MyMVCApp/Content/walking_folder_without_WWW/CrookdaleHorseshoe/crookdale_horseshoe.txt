LD001 (NY 55150 05450) 352m Parking on open grass verge below Crookdale Bridge

Look out for multi coloured wall near summit of Great Yarlside (see picture page 209 CLF)

LD002 (NY 54325 04825) 495m Summit of High House Bank (B)
LD003 (NY 53038 05850) 493m Summit of Robin Hood (B)
LD004 (NY 51838 06588) 524m Summit of Lord's Seat on High House Fell (B)

I have used the tiny 490m contour GR for the summit of Whatshaw (all one word on OD maps). Birkett must have missed this because he has the height down as 485m which is the spot height exactly 60 metres south of the contour

LD005 (NY 51550 07150) 470m Crookdale Fold
LD006 (NY 52200 07860) 595m Summit of Great Yarlside (B)
LD007 (NY 53213 07163) 516m Summit of Little Yarlside (B)
LD008 (NY 54200 06175) 490m Summit of Whatshaw (B)
LD009 (NY 54763 06225) 484m East Top of Whatshaw

      Crookdale Beck twists out of sight of the famous Shap Pass between the grassy mounds of High House Bank and What Shaw. A circuit of this hidden valley, flanked on either side by grassy shoulders, provides a walk which may well be of interest to the etymologist, ornithologist or botonist. Indeed, escape down the bog strewn valley bottom is not by any means an attractive proposition. From a point just beyond the old stone barn, climb the hillside directly to the fell wall topped by a fence. Through-stones provide a convenient stile. Bear left over thick grass to the prominent cairn on the shoulder. Just above the cairn find the grass and bilberry mound top of High House Bank.

      Descend the shoulder through the gate in the fence to gain the col. Slightly boggy ground rises to a stone wall and gate. Beyond, bearing slightly left, make a steep ascent to the grassy summit of Robin Hood. There is a fine ancient cairn below to the west overlooking Borrowdale. The going now improves considerably as does the general ambience of the walk. Follow a vague but satisfactory track all the way along the shoulder to the grassy platform of Lord's Seat. It is slightly ridged to the south and this must be regarded as the top. There is no cairn here. (We’ll make one!) Harrop Pike lies a considerable distance and height away at the head of upper Crookdale. The terrain of rocky knolls and peat hags do not allow it to be easily reached from here. It is better to swing right across the head of Crookdale through the peat hags, over three little streams and above the stone walls of Crookdale Fold. A vague grassy path rises steeply up the hillside to the right of the ravine formed by the third stream.

      Cross a small rocky outcrop and gain the easier terrain of Lawyer's Brow before striking rightwards to join an attractively coloured stone wall. Its main rocks are a crystalline rhyolite, hued from white to pink, and these are capped by those of dark Bannisdale slate. Follow the wall across the indistinct summit of Great Yarlside to a grass mound on the right. Descend along the shoulder until a gap in the wall leads to the highest point of Little Yarlside. This turns out in actual fact to be the rim of a quarried hollow.

      Descend on the right side of the wall, through Scotch thistles to the col. Rise again, taking the stile over the fence before bearing right over rough ground which rises to a fine cairn on a ruined wall. Follow the old wall line to stride a fence and gain the highest grassy top of What Shaw. Proceed along the fence to the left and rise to the second lesser top of What Shaw. Descend to another fence. Bear right to a track and follow it through the gate, beyond which it is joined by another track from the right through the gates to Crookdale Bridge Farm.
