Marylyn parent/child regions
----------------------------

There are a number of parent/child marylyn regions. Where there is a child, hills are linked to the
child region - no hills are linked to the parent region.

There are some parent only regions. Here, hills are linked to the parent region.

Want to be able to select a parent region and if there are child regions, to get the hills associated
with all the children.


Created table MarylynParentChild
Added parent/children for M17


select * from arealink where arearef in
    ( select childregionarearef from marylynparentchild where parentregionarearef='M17')

gives 179 rows  - correct.

Much simpler solution is to use  Where hillarealink.Arearef.Contains(strAreaRef) - so this will
get "children" anyway.
